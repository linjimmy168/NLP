Department of Economic and Social Aff airs

The Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat is a vital 
interface between global policies in the economic, social and environmental spheres and 
national action.  The Department works in three main interlinked areas:  (i) it compiles, 
generates and analyses a wide range of economic, social and environmental data and 
information on which States Members of the United Nations draw to review common 
problems and to take stock of policy options; (ii) it facilitates the negotiations of Member 
States in many intergovernmental bodies on joint courses of action to address ongoing 
or emerging global challenges; and (iii) it advises interested Governments on the ways 
and means of translating policy frameworks developed in United Nations conferences and 
summits into programmes at the country level and, through technical assistance, helps 
build national capacities.

Preface

As the international community shapes its vision for a post-2015 global 
development agenda, worsening inequalities across and within many countries 
have been an important part of the discussions. There is a growing recognition 
among stakeholders that economic growth is not suffi cient to sustainably reduce 
poverty if it is not inclusive. 

When world leaders adopted the Millennium Declaration in 2000, they 
pledged to create a more equitable world. Yet, in many countries, the ladder 
of opportunity has become much harder to climb. Large disparities in access 
to health and education services, land and other productive assets between the 
richest and the poorest households persist. Wealth inequalities are inherited across 
generations and are present across locations, trapping large pockets of society in 
poverty and exclusion. 

Across the globe, people living in poverty and vulnerable social groups 
have been hit particularly hard by the global fi nancial and economic crisis 
and its aftermath, adding urgency to the need to address inequalities and their 
consequences. There is growing global consensus on the need to bridge the divide 
between the haves and the have-nots. 

As underscored in the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on 
Sustainable Development (Rio+20), fi nding ways to effectively reduce inequality 
will require a transformative change and an inclusive approach to the three 
dimensions of sustainable development – economic, social and environmental. 
Properly balanced social, economic and environmental policies and institutions 
can help reduce inequalities when they ensure equality of opportunity, foster job 
creation and ensure access to adequate social protection for all. Much can be learnt 
from those countries that managed to reduce inequality even under an uncertain 
and volatile global environment. The international community can play a role in 
providing support to policies that help reduce inequality. 

Eight years after the 2005 issue of the Report on the World Social Situation, 
which warned the world of an inequality predicament, this Report on the World 
Social Situation 2013: Inequality Matters brings renewed attention to inequality. 
The Report places special focus on the impacts of inequality and highlights 
policies that have been effective at reducing inequality and have helped improve 
the situation of disadvantaged and marginalized social groups. 

The Report illustrates that growing inequalities can be arrested by integrated 
policies that are universal in principle while paying particular attention to the 
needs of disadvantaged and marginalized populations. It reminds world leaders 
that, in addressing inequalities, policy matters.

The Report shows that inequality does not affect only the poor, but can be 
detrimental to growth, stability and well-being in general. It aims to provide 



effective guidance on striking the necessary macroeconomic and social policy 
balance for achieving sustainable development and in doing so, also seeks to 
provide practical inputs to the ongoing multi-stakeholder consultations to elaborate 
the post-2015 global development agenda.

OVERVIEW

World leaders, in adopting the Millennium Declaration in 2000, pledged to create 
a more equitable world. Yet, income inequality has increased in many countries 
over the last few decades, as the wealthiest individuals have become wealthier 
while the relative situation of people living in poverty has improved little. 
Disparities in education, health and other dimensions of human development 
still remain large despite marked progress in reducing the gaps. Various social 
groups, especially indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities and rural 
populations, suffer disproportionately from income poverty and inadequate 
access to quality services and, generally, disparities between these groups and 
the rest of the population have increased over time.

This is not new. The Report on the World Social Situation 2005 warned of 
an inequality predicament and concluded that failure to pursue a comprehensive, 
integrated approach to development would perpetuate such a predicament, 
causing all to pay the price. The Report on the World Social Situation 2013 
builds on that earlier report, emphasizing that addressing inequalities is not only 
a moral imperative but it is also necessary in order to unleash the human and 
productive potential of each country’s population and to bring development 
towards a socially-sustainable path. The Report examines recent inequality 
trends and analyses their social, economic and political impacts, highlighting new 
developments and paying particular attention to the situation of disadvantaged 
social groups. It shows that inequality not only matters to people living in poverty, 
but also for the overall well-being of society. The Report illustrates that growing 
inequalities can be arrested by integrated policies that are universal in principle 
yet pay particular attention to the needs of disadvantaged and marginalized 
populations. It reminds world leaders that, in addressing inequalities, policy 
matters.

While income inequality across countries has receded somewhat in recent 
years, it has risen within many countries. Non-economic inequalities have either  
remained stable or declined, yet remain high. Chapters 1 and 2 present these 
trends, and compare inequality across regions. The chapters show that some 
countries have defi ed the general trend and managed to reduce inequalities, 
demonstrating that policies can make a difference. 

The implications of rising inequality for social and economic development 
are many. There is growing evidence and recognition of the powerful and 
corrosive effects of inequality on economic growth, poverty reduction, social 
and economic stability and socially-sustainable development. Chapter 3 



22 Inequality matters

discusses these impacts and concludes that the many adverse consequences of 
inequality affect the well-being not only of those at the bottom of the income 
distribution, but also those at the top. Specifi cally, inequality leads to a less 
stable, less effi cient economic system that stifl es economic growth and the 
participation of all members of society in the labour market (Stiglitz, 2012).  
With high income inequality, the rich control a greater share of the income. As 
richer households typically spend a smaller share of their income than the poor, 
this unequal concentration of income and wealth reduces aggregate demand 
and can slow down economic growth. Inequalities also pose a serious barrier to 
social development by slowing the pace of poverty reduction. Inequality limits 
opportunities for social mobility, including intergenerational mobility.  Income 
inequality leads to uneven access to health and education and, therefore, to the 
intergenerational transmission of unequal economic and social opportunities, 
creating poverty traps, wasting human potential, and resulting in less dynamic, 
less creative societies. Inequality also increases the vulnerability of societies 
(and, especially, of particular groups within societies) to economic crises and 
prolongs the time it takes to recover from such crises. These varied impacts can 
combine to generate potent sources of social tension, fertile ground for political 
and civil unrest, instability and heightened human insecurity.

Inequality is also an issue of social justice. People want to live in societies 
that are fair, where hard work is rewarded, and where one’s socioeconomic 
position can be improved regardless of one’s background. A unique contribution 
of the present Report is that it zeroes in, in Chapter 4, on the challenges facing 
disadvantaged and marginalized social groups, and draws particular attention 
to the issue of social justice. It examines the distinct impacts of inequalities 
on youth, older persons, persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and 
migrants. The disadvantages faced by these groups reinforce one another. 
Young people and older persons across the globe experience a broad range of 
disadvantages that are associated with their age. Indigenous peoples generally 
fare worse than the non-indigenous in every socioeconomic dimension. There 
are also signifi cant social inequalities between persons with disabilities and 
the general population in educational and health outcomes and in access to 
full and productive employment and decent work opportunities. Migrants also 
face manifold disadvantages, including discrimination. Disadvantages are 
greater among women than among men within these groups. The chapter draws 
attention to the measures policymakers should take to identify disadvantaged 
groups, and implement policies addressing different social groups’ needs to 
combat inequalities effectively. 

The global fi nancial and economic crisis and its aftermath (see Chapter 3) 
have added urgency to the need to address inequalities and their consequences. 
Draconian fi scal austerity programmes still dominate attempts to reduce 
sovereign debt in many developed countries, and a growing number of developing 
countries are cutting public expenditure. Popular discontent has grown and trust 
in Governments is dwindling, even in countries with consolidated democracies, 



Overview 23

as people believe they are bearing the brunt of crises for which they have no 
responsibility and feel increasingly disenfranchised. Furthermore, the slow—
and still unstable—recovery in output has not resulted in an across-the-board 
recovery in jobs and wages, leaving millions to struggle under the burden of the 
crisis. The social contract is under threat in many of these countries. Given the 
current political context, it is important to bring forth evidence-based strategies 
to address this persistent problem. Much can be learned from countries that have 
been able to reduce inequalities despite the uncertain global economic outlook.

Indeed, the experience of some countries shows that growing inequality is 
neither destiny nor a necessary price to pay for economic growth. Policy makes 
a difference. A fundamental premise of the 2013 Report is that policies are also 
responsible for growing or, conversely, declining inequality. Chapter 5 focuses 
on policy measures that have been effective in addressing inequality and brings 
the analysis of the volume to bear on policy recommendations that address 
various aspects of inequality. It emphasizes that gains made through targeted 
interventions alone are unlikely to be sustained without broad-based coverage. 
It suggests that a set of cohesive, coherent and complementary policies is needed 
to combat inequality in all its dimensions. 

As the international community pledges to accelerate progress towards 
achieving the Millennium Development Goals and shapes its global vision for 
the development agenda after 2015, stakeholders recognize that, along with 
eradicating poverty, tackling inequalities should be at the core. The Report on 
the World Social Situation 2013 aims at providing effective guidance on striking 
the necessary macroeconomic and social policy balance for achieving this end, 
and creating inclusive and equitable societies for all. 

The Report offers some key policy recommendations for consideration:
• The promotion of productive employment and decent work for all 
should be an objective not only of social policy but also of macroeconomic 
policy.

• The emphasis in public spending must be on universal, good-quality, 
essential services such as health, nutrition, sanitation and education. 
Access to education at all levels, in particular, has signifi cant distributional 
effects. 

• Urgent action must be taken to establish, and extend, a basic social 
protection fl oor that ensures access to basic services for all. Fiscal 
consolidation measures must be designed in such a way as not to 
undermine essential public spending on such services.

• The basic principle of universalism must be combined with particular 
policy focus on disadvantaged groups, especially those affected by 
multiple deprivations. Gender inequalities are cross-cutting and must be 
addressed actively when dealing with all other dimensions of inequality. 



24 Inequality matters

• In all policy matters, relational inequalities and socially- and 
culturally- generated patterns of discrimination and exclusion must be 
confronted.

Chapter 1 

Recent trends in economic inequality

Disparities in income, wealth and consumption have tended to dominate the 
discussion on inequality, not only because they contribute directly to the well-
being of individuals and families, but also because they shape the opportunities 
people have in life as well as their children’s future: access to goods and 
services available on the market depends on economic resources as do—to a 
considerable degree—good educational outcomes and good health. Chapter 1 
describes different kinds of economic inequality across and within countries and 
compares levels and trends of inequality across regions.

The evidence presented shows that economic inequalities have declined 
somewhat across countries in recent years but they have risen within many 
countries, as wealthier individuals have become wealthier while the relative 
situation of the poorer segments of the population has not improved. However, 
trends have been far from universal: as countries have grown and developed, 
inequalities have increased, in many cases, and have declined in some others. 
Successful cases of reducing inequalities illustrate the importance of policies 
and institutions in shaping inequality trends.

I. Trends in global economic inequality

Globally, the distribution of income remains very uneven. In 2010, high-income 
countries – that accounted for only 16 per cent of the world’s population – were 
estimated to generate 55 per cent of global income.1 Low-income countries 
created just above one per cent of global income even though they contained 
72 per cent of global population. An average gross domestic product (GDP) per 
capita of $ 2,014 in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010 stood out against regional GDPs 
per capita of $ 27,640 in the European Union and $ 41,399 in North America. 

1 High-income countries are those with a gross national income (GNI) per capita of 
$12,476 or more in 2011, while low-income countries are those with a GNI per capita of 
$1,025 or less, according to the World Bank. GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity 
(PPP) at 2005 constant international dollars from the World Bank World Development 
Indicators Database, accessed between 15 and 30 July 2012 and available [online] at:

26 Inequality matters

The magnitude and direction of change in income distribution among 
countries since 1980 depend signifi cantly on the indicator used. One way of 
measuring international inequality is to examine the Gini coeffi cient of per capita 
incomes of countries. This Gini coeffi cient has been calculated by taking each 
country’s GDP per capita as one observation or data point.  Figure I.1 shows 
trends in this non-weighted Gini coeffi cient of international inequality, as well 
as trends in a variant of this coeffi cient, obtained by weighting each national 
GDP per capita by each country’s population–to account for the fact that China’s 
economic growth, for instance, should have affected more people than growth in 
a smaller country. Based on this population-weighted Gini, international income 
inequality has been declining since the early 1980s. Statistically, most of this 
decline has been due to the rapid growth of China. 

Figure I.1 indicates that international income inequality increased quite 
sharply between 1980 and 2000, both measured through the weighted Gini, if 
China is excluded, and through the non-weighted Gini. Several factors played 
a role in this, particularly declining incomes in Latin America during the ‘lost 
decade’ of the 1980s and the prolonged economic implosion of countries in sub-
Saharan Africa, as well as the economic collapse of transition countries in the 
late 1980s and 1990s. However, since about 2000, the decline in international

Recent trends in economic inequality 27

inequality has been observable even without China. Stronger economic growth 
in all three major developing regions (Asia, Africa and Latin America) has 
contributed to this trend.

Despite this recent improvement, international inequality remains very high 
–in fact, excluding China, the Gini coeffi cients of international inequality were 
higher in 2010 than they had been in 1980. That is, the country where a person 
was born, or where they live, is an important determinant of their expected 
income, given the enduring, large disparities in national income per capita. 

In addition, while low-income countries have been growing faster than high-
income countries and international inequality is falling, the absolute gap in mean 
per capita incomes between these two groups of countries increased from $ 18,525 
in 1980 to close to $ 32,900 in 2007, before falling slightly to $ 32,000 in 2010.2 
The absolute gap between incomes per capita of low- and upper-middle income 
countries has more than doubled, from around $ 3,000 in 1980 to $ 7,600 in 2010.

The magnitude of income disparities across countries is large, but so are 
disparities across individuals within each country. Figure I.2 shows national 
GDP per capita as well as average GDP per capita of the top and bottom 10 per 
cent of the population of selected countries. The mean income of a resident of 
Albania or Russia was lower than that of an individual in the lowest 10 per cent 
of the distribution in Sweden, who also earned almost 6 times more than an 
Albanian in the bottom 10 per cent of their country’s distribution, 80 times more 
than a Bolivian in the bottom decile, and 200 times more than an individual in 
the bottom decile in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the late 2000s. 
At times, income distributions of different countries, even within the same 
region, barely overlap. For instance, the average income of an individual in the 
bottom decile in South Africa is higher than that of an individual in the richest 
decile in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.3 Yet, internal distribution 
also has a strong impact on the relative economic situation of individuals in 
different countries. Poor people in more unequal countries can have lower living 
standards than poor people in countries with lower average incomes but less 
unequal distribution. For instance, individuals in the bottom 10 per cent earned 
less in the United States than in Sweden, in Brazil than in Indonesia, and in 
South Africa than in Egypt in the late 2000s.

30 July 2012.
3  These comparisons should be interpreted with caution, as they are based on income 
estimates derived using PPP exchange rates. These have several problems, especially when 
comparing incomes at the lower end of the distribution, because they are based on the 
prices of an average basket of goods that may not be representative of the basket consumed 
by the poor in different societies, and the prices themselves are estimated through relatively 
infrequent country surveys upon which local infl ation rates are applied. 



28 Inequality matters

It is possible to estimate the global distribution of income along these lines, 
that is, going beyond the mean incomes of each country, by combining data on 
domestic income distribution from household surveys and adjusting incomes 
using purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates to translate domestic 
currencies into international dollars (Milanovic, 2012). Based on this method, 
global inequality measured by the Gini coeffi cient increased from 68.4 per cent 
in 1988 to 69.4 per cent in 1998 and reached 70.7 per cent in 2005 – a level of 
inequality larger than that found in any one country. The income share of the 
top 10 per cent of the world population increased from around 51.5 per cent to 
55.5 per cent during the period. Since this measure of global inequality among 
individuals refl ects, in principle, inequalities within and across countries, and 
since inequalities across countries did not increase in this period, the rise in 
global inequality must be due to increased inequalities within countries. Chen 
and Ravallion (2012) suggested that within-country inequalities explained less 
than one third of total income inequality in the developing world as a whole in 
1981, but that they constituted more than half of total inequality in 2008.

Recent trends in economic inequality 29

II.  Recent patterns of inequality within countries

A. Trends and patterns in income inequality

Income distribution has become increasingly unequal in the majority of developed 
countries and some large developing countries in the last twenty years, but 
trends differ markedly between countries and regions. Between 1990 and 2012, 
inequality in disposable income, that is, income after taxes and transfers, increased 
in 65 out of 130 countries for which data trends are available, as shown in table 
I.1.4 These countries are home to more than two thirds of the world population. In 
many of them, inequality has risen more or less continuously. In others, including 
several countries with economies in transition, inequality trends have followed an 
N-shape – that is, inequality rose in the 1990s, declined or remained stable in the 
late 1990s or early 2000s, and began rising again during the 2000s. In the majority 
of those countries where income inequality has declined, trends have followed an 
inverted U shape – inequality increased in the early 1990s and started to decline in 
the late 1990s or early 2000s.

However, recent trends differ markedly by region. In general, income 
inequality has increased in countries and regions that enjoyed relatively low levels 
of inequality in 1990, and has declined in some countries that still suffer from high 
inequality.  Namely, some large, emerging economies, and the large majority of 
developed countries, have experienced sharp rises in Gini coeffi cients since 1990, 
including Nordic countries with traditionally low levels of inequality. The rise in 
income inequality has been particularly fast in Eastern Europe.  

Although Latin America and the Caribbean remains one of the regions with 
the highest levels of income inequality apart from Africa, the Gini coeffi cient 
declined between 1990 and 2012 in 14 out of the 20 Latin American countries 
for which data are available, including Brazil, which has traditionally had very 
high levels of inequality (Solt, 2013). According to the information available, 
the gap between the rich and the poor declined in many African countries as 
well, including very high-inequality countries such as Botswana, Lesotho and 
Swaziland, but continued to increase relatively quickly in South Africa during 
the post-apartheid period, despite continued economic growth and the expansion 
of social assistance programmes. In 2008, South Africa’s Gini coeffi cient stood 
at around 70 (World Bank, 2012a).5  

4  For an overview of data and indicators of economic inequality, see annex to Chapter 
1. The description of recent inequality trends focuses on the period 1990-2012 so as to 
ensure maximum data coverage and reliability–for instance, inequality indicators are not 
widely available in countries of Central Asia and Eastern Europe before 1990; where they 
are available, the estimated measurement errors are relatively high. For more information, 
see Solt (2009). Data available from: http://www.siuc.edu/~fsolt/swiid/swiid.html.   
5  Inter-racial inequality has remained high in South Africa but fell during this period; 
meanwhile, intra-racial income inequality increased, especially in urban areas (Leibbrandt

Recent trends in economic inequality 31

Historically, Asia has experienced lower inequality than other developing 
regions. However, despite remarkable growth and impressive declines in 
extreme poverty, the region has seen widespread increases in income inequality 
at the national level, as well as in both urban and rural areas. Between 1990 and 
2012, income inequality rose in 18 out of 31 countries with data–accounting for 
over 80 per cent of the region’s population. Most notable among them has been 
China, where inequality increased both in urban areas (with the Gini growing 
from 25.6 in 1990 to 35.2 in 2010) as well as in rural areas (from 30.6 to 39.4), 
leaving rural areas more unequal than urban areas – a position unlike that of 
most developing countries.6 

In countries where inequality has declined, two key factors have contributed 
to such declines: the expansion of education, and public transfers to the poor. 
Starting in the early 1990s, increases in public expenditure on education 
throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, for instance, led to rising secondary 
enrolment and completion rates, and this became a major determinant of the fall 
in wage inequality (Ferreira and others, 2012; López-Calva and Lustig, 2010). 
This increase in public spending was, itself, the result of a shift in the economic 
policy model followed by many countries in the region. In general, there was 
growing social consensus on the need for Governments to serve as the engines 
of development, providing social protection as well as public infrastructure 
(Cornia, forthcoming). 

In countries where inequality has risen, income is concentrated increasingly 
at the very top of the distribution ladder. The share of income owned by the 
top quintile of the population increased in the majority of countries (61 out 
of 111) although it did not increase globally from 1990 to the mid-2000s 
(Ortiz and Cummins, 2011, table 5, p.16). However, income shares have risen 
signifi cantly among the top 5 per cent and, particularly, among the top 1 per 
cent of the population. Much like the Gini coeffi cient, top income shares have 
increased since the 1980s, according to data available for the 16 developed and 
6 developing countries shown in table I.27. 

Gains have been largest at the very top. In the United States of America, for 
instance, the average income of the top 5 per cent increased at an annual rate of 1.5 
per cent between 1980 and 2011, while the growth rate of the income of the top 0.1 
per cent was 4.0 per cent. In contrast, the average real income of the bottom 99 per 
cent of income-earners grew at an annual rate of only 0.6 per cent between 1976 

and others, 2010).

Recent trends in economic inequality 33

and 2007 in the United States, which implies that the top 1 per cent captured 58 per 
cent of income growth (Atkinson, Piketty and Saez, 2011). While average incomes 
grew faster in the United States than in France during that period, the incomes of 
the bottom 99 per cent grew more slowly in the former. Therefore, excluding the 
top 1 per cent results in more inclusive, and more equitable, economic growth by 
France than by the United States of America.  

Therefore, inequality has increased mainly because the wealthiest individuals 
have become wealthier, both in developed and developing countries where the 
necessary data were available. Palma (2011) observed that, in absolute terms, the 
top 10 per cent of the population in middle-income countries has succeeded in 
catching up with the top 10 per cent in rich countries, while the bottom 40 per cent 
of the population of middle-income countries is still far below its counterpart in 
rich countries—even in relative terms—regarding their share of national income. 
The author proposed an alternative to the Gini coeffi cient for measuring income 
inequality: the ratio of the top 10 per cent of the population’s share of income to 
the bottom 40 per cent’s share. Overall, the ranking of countries according to this 
‘Palma ratio’ conforms to other measures of inequality, but trends can differ from 
changes in the Gini (Cobham and Sumner, 2013). For example, the value of the 
Gini coeffi cient declined from 1990 to 2010 in countries such as Mexico, Nigeria 
and the United Republic of Tanzania, while the Palma ratio increased. That is, 
even though income inequality as measured by the Gini coeffi cient declined in 
those countries, the share of income of the top 10 per cent has increased relative to 
that of the bottom 40 per cent–or, alternatively, the share of the bottom 40 per cent 
has declined. Conversely, Pakistan and the Philippines experienced increasing 
inequality based on the Gini coeffi cient, but not by the Palma ratio. 

B. Other dimensions of economic inequality

Income inequality measures do not capture all household wealth – which, in 
addition to income earned, may include ownership of capital, including physical 
assets (land, housing) and fi nancial assets. While the two are highly correlated, 
the distribution of wealth is typically more unequal than the distribution of 
income. In a considerable effort to collect comparable data across countries, 
Davies and others (2008) found that the Gini coeffi cient of wealth ranged 
between 55 and 80 per cent in a sample of 26 countries in the year 2000 and 
that the share of wealth owned by the top 10 per cent of the population ranged 
from 40 to 70 per cent.8 In contrast, the share of income owned by the top 10 per 
cent ranged from 20 to 43 per cent in a sample of 26 developed and developing 
countries with data (Alvaredo and others, 2012).  

8  Although the work by Davies and others (2007) is the most recent and comprehensive 
to date, sources of data (household surveys of differing purpose and sampling frame, 
in some cases, tax records in other cases), the economic unit of analysis (households, 
individuals or adults, depending on the country) and data quality affect their comparability, 
particularly when it comes to estimates that require data from the full wealth spectrum. 
Therefore, the estimates cited should be interpreted with caution.



34 Inequality matters

However, wealth inequality appears to have increased less than income 
inequality, or even declined in some countries. In the United States of America, 
for instance, the share of wealth owned by the top 1 per cent was slightly lower 
in 2001 (33.4 per cent) than in 1983 (33.8 per cent) (Davies and others, 2008). 
One explanation for this is that, to a large extent, the rise in top income share has 
been brought about by growing earnings dispersion, rather than by an increase 
in capital income, and particularly by a rise in executive compensation (Ebert, 
Torres and Papadakis, 2008; Atkison, Piketty and Saez, 2011). Another likely 
explanation, which may apply to the pre-crisis period, is the housing bubble. 
Ownership of real assets, and particularly housing, has been relatively more 
important for individuals in the middle and bottom of the income-distribution 
ranking than for those at the top, who might rely to a larger extent on fi nancial 
assets. Thus, increases in real estate prices tend to reduce top wealth shares and 
other measures of wealth inequality, and may have countered the trend towards 
higher wealth inequality due to higher share prices and increasing returns to 
fi nancial assets, in general.

In many developing countries, the distribution of land ownership has been 
particularly relevant in explaining inequality. Land concentration remains 
particularly high in Latin America, followed by Western Asia and Northern 
Africa (Vollrath, 2007; World Bank, 2005). Highly-unequal land distribution has 
created social and political tensions and is a source of economic ineffi ciency, as 
small landholders frequently lack access to credit and other resources to increase 
productivity, while big owners may not have had enough incentive to do so. 
However, attempts at land reform have been successful only in a few countries, 
mainly in Eastern Asia (World Bank, 2003; 2005). Broader rural development 
strategies and complementary measures that would be easier to implement 
politically, such as access to education and infrastructure, are greatly needed to 
enhance land equity and productivity.

There have also been important changes in the distribution of income 
between capital and labour. While the period of expansion that preceded the 
economic and fi nancial crises was accompanied by employment growth across 
most regions, such growth occurred alongside a redistribution of income 
towards capital and away from labour. In developed countries, the share of 
wages in total income declined from 74 per cent in 1980 to close to 65 per 
cent in 2010 (Stockhammer, 2013). In developing countries with available data, 
wage shares have declined as well–by as much as 20 percentage points, on 
average, in Mexico, the Republic of Korea and Turkey–although trends have 
varied markedly by country (Stockhammer, 2013; ILO, 2012a; IMF, 2007). For 
instance, wage shares fell the most in Latin America and the Caribbean during 
the 1980s and 1990s but have increased signifi cantly in several countries–
Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela–since 2000 (Cornia, 2011; 2012). 
Declines in the wage share, where these have taken place, have been attributed 
to the impact of labour-saving technological change and to a general weakening 
of labour market regulations and institutions (namely, decreased unionization). 



Recent trends in economic inequality 35

Such declines are likely to affect individuals in the middle and bottom of the 
income distribution disproportionately, since they rely mostly on labour income.

In addition, the wage gap between top and bottom earners has also increased 
in the majority of developed countries and in many developing countries with 
data (Galbraith, 2012; ILO IILS, 2008; OECD 2013). On the one hand, there has 
been an increase in non-standard forms of employment–including temporary 
and part-time employment, in developed countries, and informal-sector work in 
developing countries–which are generally less well-remunerated than standard 
employment. Labour-saving technologies have also had a negative impact on the 
earnings of less-skilled workers in developed countries (Stockhammer, 2013). 
On the other hand, top salaries have increased signifi cantly. Atkison, Piketty and 
Saez (2011) found that a signifi cant proportion of gains in top income shares are 
due to increases in top labour incomes. That is, those at the top of the income 
ladder are not only capital owners, as used to be the case in the fi rst half of the 
twentieth century, but also top wage earners (see also Piketty, 2003; and Wolff 
and Zacharias, 2009). The rise in pay of top executives has attracted considerable 
attention in the past few years, particularly in the context of the recent crises. 
Ebert, Torres and Papadakis (2008) found that, in 2007, chief executive offi cers 
of the 15 largest companies in six selected countries earned between 71 and 183 
times more than the average employee–excluding share-based compensation. 
Focusing on the United States and the Netherlands, they also showed that the 
gap between executive and employee pay grew considerably between the early 
2000s and 2007.

Although increases in executive compensation have not outpaced growth in 
employee pay or infl ation in the United States or Europe since the fi nancial crisis, 
the gap has remained very large (Mishel and Sabadish, 2013; Hay Group, 2013). 
In the United States, for instance, compensation of chief executive offi cers of the 
top 350 companies – including salary and bonuses – was 221 times higher than 
the average employee’s pay in 2007, and remained 202 times higher in 2012 
(Mishel, 2013). Since the crisis started, several European countries, including 
the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, have enacted legislation that 
has put restrictions on executive pay (Mercer, 2013). 

As will be discussed in chapter 5, investment in education, labour market 
institutions and regulations can change this pattern of increasing wage inequality, 
even in highly-integrated economies. For example, the reduction in income 
inequality in Latin America has been related to the reduction in wage inequality 
which, in turn, is related to the more equalizing role played by the spread of 
education (Cornia, forthcoming). Well-designed minimum-wage policies can 
have very signifi cant, positive effects in reducing wage inequality. Recently, 
countries like Brazil, South Africa and Viet Nam have succeeded in reducing 
wage inequalities largely through higher minimum wages, which also were 
found to have statistically negligible adverse effects on levels of employment 
(ILO, 2012a).

C.  Growth and inequality: policies matter

Regional and national trends in economic inequality suggest that there is no 
clear relationship between inequality and development: income disparities have 
increased in many countries, and have declined in some others, as countries 
have grown and developed in the last 25 years. Yet, increasing inequality has 
been assumed as a cost of the development process, probably based on the 
Kuznets (1955) proposition that inequality tends to be low at the early stages of 
development when societies are mostly agricultural, and inequalities increase as 
industry develops, countries urbanize and economies grow faster. As countries 
develop further, increased wealth would enable the introduction of broad-based 
education and social protection, and the growing political power of urban lower-
income groups would result in support for more even income distributions. As a 
result, inequality would follow the shape of an inverted U curve. 

The empirical evidence on such a relationship between inequality and 
development is ambiguous, at best.9 A comparison of income distributions 
across countries by gross national income (GNI) per capita in 2012 shows a 
slightly inverted U shape, but country observations are signifi cantly scattered 
and the correlation between the two variables is small: countries at similar levels 
of income per capita have very different levels of income inequality (see fi gure 
I.3). The shape of these cross-sectional distributions may have more to do with 
the history of each country and region and their situation in 2012 than with the 
assumed relationship between inequality and development. For example, Latin 
American countries, the majority of which are middle-income countries, have 
been more unequal throughout their history than countries in other regions. 

Trends within individual countries have also been different from those 
which this theory predicts. Namely, inequality has increased in some middle-
income countries and has declined in others. The contrasting experiences of 
Brazil, China and India have been widely discussed in the literature (see, for 
instance, Bourguignon, Ferreira and Lustig, eds., 2005; Deaton and Kozel, 2005; 
Chaudhuri and Ravaillon, 2006). While Brazil continues to suffer from record-
high levels of income inequality, recent economic growth has benefi ted the 
poor, due—in part—to improvements in education, labour market conditions, 
and the expansion of social assistance programmes, including Bolsa Familia, 
the world’s largest conditional cash transfer programme. In contrast, the 
unprecedented growth enjoyed by China and, to a lesser extent, India, has been 
accompanied by rising inequality. Income inequality has also increased in most 
developed countries–instead of remaining stable or declining–although national 
experiences have varied signifi cantly across the developed world, as well. 

9  For a summary of the empirical literature on inequality and development, see Atkinson 
and Bourguignon, eds., (2000). Additional references are found in Salvedra, Nolan and 
Smeeding, eds., (2011). For a recent cross-country assessment, see Palma (2011).

D.  The power of redistribution

A signifi cant part of the difference observed in disposable income disparities 
across countries can be explained by the redistributive impact of social 
transfers and taxes. Both should have immediate, direct effects on income 
distribution, although the magnitude of their impact will depend on the degree 
of progressiveness of the tax system (income and property taxes are usually 
progressive, while indirect taxes are regressive) and on the degree to which the 
poor benefi t from social transfers and social insurance. The negative effects of 
indirect taxes on the incomes of the poor, or nearly-poor, can be stronger than 
the positive effects of cash transfers (Lustig, 2012).

According to the empirical literature, social transfers have had a larger 
redistributive impact than taxes. Wang and Caminada (2011) estimated that 
social transfers accounted for 85 per cent of the observed reduction in inequality

in a sample of 36 countries, while taxes explained 15 per cent of such a reduction. 
Similarly, according to Doerrenberg and Peichl (2012), a 1 per cent increase 
in Government spending on social transfers was correlated with a 0.3 per cent 
drop in inequality in member countries of the OECD, while the effect of tax 
progressivity was much smaller.10  

Over time, the redistributive impact of social transfers and taxes has failed to 
correct the trend of rising income inequality in developed countries. From 1990 
to 2007, a period of global policy shift toward less Government intervention 
and greater reliance on market forces, the relative difference between the Gini 
coeffi cient of market income and that of disposable income—the extent of 
redistribution—declined, or remained constant, in six out of the 12 countries 
shown in fi gure I.4 (Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, Spain, Israel 
and Chile). On average, the difference remained relatively stable, increasing 
only from 10.6 to 11.8 points of the Gini coeffi cient, meaning that disparities in 

10  Declines in tax progressivity, however, are found to be important determinants of the 
increase in top income shares (Atkinson, Piketty and Saez, 2011).

disposable income rose almost as much as disparities in market income in the 
countries shown. The economic crisis brought about increased redistribution in 
some countries between 2007 and 2011–in Sweden, Denmark and, to a lesser 
extent, in Italy and the United Kingdom. However, the redistributive impact of 
taxes and transfers in most of the countries shown in fi gure I.4 declined during 
the fi rst four years of the crisis. With important exceptions, policies have not 
become increasingly redistributive as inequality has grown. 

III. Conclusion

Inequality trends have not followed a universal pattern.  Economic inequalities 
across countries remain very large, but have declined somewhat, while income 
disparities have increased within many countries over the last two decades, 
particularly in countries and regions that had enjoyed relatively low levels of 
inequality in 1990. However, some countries of Latin America and Africa have 
been able to reduce economic inequalities. 

Despite the broad expectation that inequalities should decline systematically 
as societies develop, or remain low in developed societies, evidence shows that 
the move towards less inequality is not automatic. Rather, policies must actively 
pursue such a goal. Indeed, the empirical evidence presented suggests that much 
depends on country-specifi c conditions and national policymaking. The poor 
are more likely to benefi t from economic growth and share in the gains from 
globalization when there are pro-poor national policies in place, where growth 
is equitable, and labour markets inclusive. Chapter 5 discusses this further 
and shows that countries that have used redistributive fi scal policy measures, 
developed universal social protection programmes, or even wide-ranging social 
assistance, with emphasis on education and health spending, and those that have 
increased labour-market opportunities for those at the bottom, have weathered 
better the general trend towards growing within-country inequality.

Annex to Chapter 1: 

Data and indicators of economic inequality
There are different ways of measuring and summarizing the distribution of 
income and the levels of economic inequality among individuals or households. 
While each of the indicators available has strengths and limitations, their 
appropriateness can be assessed against a number of criteria. For instance, 
indicators of economic inequality must be scale-invariant: their values should 
not change when all incomes change proportionally. They must also satisfy the 
principle of transfers, whereby transferring income from a richer to a poorer 
person should result in a reduction in inequality as measured by the indicator, and 
the reverse should also hold. They must also fulfi l the symmetry or anonymity 
axiom – the index must depend only on the income values used to construct it 
and not take into account additional information.

The most widely-used indicator of inequality, and the one used most 
extensively in the present Report, is the Gini coeffi cient, which ranges from 0 
(perfect equality) to 100 (complete inequality: one person has all the income or 
consumption while all others have none).11 Thus, the closer the coeffi cient is to 
100, the more unequal the income distribution. The Gini measures the extent 
to which the distribution of income, or the consumption expenditure among 
individuals or households, deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. It has 
clear graphical representation and is easy to interpret but, as with other measures 
of inequality, suffers from a number of limitations. For instance, it is not additive 
across groups: i.e. the total Gini for a society is not equal to the sum of the Ginis 
for its sub-groups (Galbraith, 2012). In addition, it does not identify whether 
rises or falls in inequality were triggered by changes at the bottom, middle or 
top of the income distribution ranking. Also, the Gini itself is more responsive 
to changes in the middle of the income distribution ladder than to changes at the 
very bottom, or at the very top (Palma, 2011).

A better indicator of income concentration at the top or the bottom of the 
distribution would be a more direct measure, such as the share of income or 
consumption of the bottom, or top 10 per cent, or top 20 per cent of the population, 
or the Palma ratio – the ratio of the top 10 per cent of the population’s share of 
income to the bottom 40 per cent’s share – also discussed in the current Report. 
The quality of data on income or consumption at the very top and bottom of the 
distribution, however, is often questionable, as discussed in the Report.

Cross-country analyses of economic inequality are affected by the consistency 
and comparability of data. Greater data coverage across countries and over time 
often comes at the cost of reduced comparability across observations. Although 
full comparability can only be achieved through concerted efforts to harmonize 

11  The Gini has been shown as a percentage in the present Report to allow for greater 
detail in the analysis.

data collection, the main source of income inequality data used in this Report, 
the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID), overcame some 
of the limitations found in other global datasets.12 One of the main sources of 
non-comparability, for instance, is  that some countries use household income 
as the main indicator of economic well-being, while others use consumption 
expenditure (Jenkins and Van Kerm, 2009). Among those that use household 
income, some datasets report income before taxes and transfers (market income), 
others report disposable or net income (after taxes and transfers), while some 
report income after taxes but before transfers. An additional factor affecting 
comparability is the reference unit over which income is measured. Solt (2009) 
identifi es fi ve main reference units that have often been used: household per 
capita, household adult-equivalent, household without adjustment, employee 
and individual. 

Based on these different defi nitions, SWIID classifi es country-year 
observations into 21 different categories (Solt, 2009). Comparability problems 
are partly overcome in the database by calculating country-specifi c ratios 
between each pair of categories where data are available. Where data are missing, 
ratios are generated on the basis of those ratios available through multi-level 
models using, when possible, ratios from the same country and for the same 
decade. Since the distribution of income within a country, typically, changes 
slowly over time, dramatic differences in estimates of inequality for a given 
year compared to those preceding or following it are likely to refl ect errors in 
measurement. In the SWIID, a fi ve-year, weighted, moving-average algorithm is 
used to allow estimates to be informed by observations for surrounding years.13 
Overall, Solt (2009) estimated that about 30 per cent of the observations in the 
database had associated standard errors of one point or less on the 0-100 scale 
of the Gini coeffi cient. Over 60 per cent of standard errors were less than two 
points, and more than 85 per cent were less than three points. Observations with 
large standard errors were concentrated in the earlier years of the period covered 
by the database (1960 to 1980).

Even though SWIID constitutes the most comprehensive effort, to date, to 
improve data comparability while maintaining broad coverage, data will not be 
strictly comparable without concerted efforts to harmonize data collection across 
countries and improve survey coverage. For now, greater comparability can only be 
achieved by narrowing the scope of analysis to one, or a few, countries. 

12  The Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID) provides Gini 
coeffi cients of disposable and market income for 153 countries for as many years as 
possible from 1960 to 2011.
13  This smoothing method was not applied to countries with high-quality data, including 
those covered by the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) (Solt, 2009).  This Report also 
showed some cases where rapid changes in inequality were likely to have taken place, 
namely in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

Chapter 2

Inequality in key aspects of 
well-being

The present chapter analyses disparities across and within countries in several 
dimensions of well-being, namely, life expectancy at birth, child survival, 
nutrition and educational attainment. Although inequality in health and 
educational outcomes across countries remains large, the past two decades have 
seen a shift towards convergence, as poorer countries have continued to make 
notable progress in improving their levels of human development. However, 
this good news is tempered by the persistence of large inequalities in health and 
education within and across both social groups and regions within countries. 
Spatial disparities may not have increased in all countries but they have remained 
high, as have inequalities in education and health. However, as with economic 
inequalities, trends are far from universal.

I. Health inequalities: Life expectancy at birth, child mortality 
and nutrition

Life expectancy at birth is a widely-used indicator of human well-being. 
Disparities in length of life refl ect inequalities in health risks and in access to 
health services; life expectancy is also a marker of a country’s economic and 
political situation, including its level of stability and human security. Over 
time, disparities in life expectancy at birth have declined across major areas 
and geographical regions, due to improvements in standards of living, nutrition, 
public hygiene, levels of education (especially female education) and technology, 
particularly simple and low-cost health interventions in the developing world 
(see fi gures II.1 and II.2). As a result, there have been marked reductions in 
deaths due to infectious diseases, congenital and prenatal conditions, and other 
ill-defi ned causes.

The absolute gap in life expectancy at birth between the more- and the 
less-developed regions shrank from 23 years in 1950-1955 to 13 years in 1980-
1985, and further, to just under 10 years, in 2005-2010. Life expectancy has 
improved more slowly in the least developed countries, particularly during the 



44 Inequality matters

‘lost decades’ (1980s and 1990s) of declines in incomes and public expenditure. 
Since 2000, however, stronger economic growth has gone hand-in-hand with 
faster progress in health, but the recovery has not been suffi cient enough to 
reduce the gap with other developing countries signifi cantly. 

Disparities in life expectancy have also declined across most geographical 
regions, with the notable exception of sub-Saharan Africa. Life expectancy at birth 
was about 14 years below the world average in 1980-1985 and over 16 years below 
in 1995-2000. Despite some progress since 2000, average life expectancy in sub-
Saharan Africa is still 16 years below that of most countries in Asia. Most of the 
relative lack of improvement in sub-Saharan Africa can be traced to the ravages 
of the HIV/AIDS epidemic that swept through much of the continent. Additional 
factors, including civil wars and other violent confl icts, are also responsible, both 
directly and through their impact on nutrition (by disrupting food supplies) as well 
as on the provision of health services and basic infrastructure.

Inequality in key aspects of well-being 45

Differences in life expectancy across some developing countries, countries 
with economies in transition and developed countries have actually increased 
since the 1980s. The mortality gap between Japan (a country with one of the 
lowest mortality rates in the world) and fi ve world subregions has increased, as 
shown in fi gure II.3. The gap in life expectancy between Japan and the Russian 
Federation, for instance, increased from 9 years in 1985-1990 to close to 16 
years in 2005-2010. A similar trend was observed in most of the countries of the 
former Soviet Union which suffered cutbacks in their health systems following 
the transition to market economies, and where public health suffered from the 
effects of high unemployment, growing inequality and other social impacts of 
the transition. The difference in life expectancy between Japan and Southern 
Africa increased from 18 to 31 years, mostly due to the impact of the AIDS 
epidemic in the latter, and remained high in Middle Africa. 

One of the most important determinants of life expectancy, especially in 
countries with high mortality rates, is the health of infants and young children.

Figure II.4 shows that, while East and Southeast Asia have experienced 
signifi cant declines in child mortality, the rate in sub-Saharan Africa has barely 
fallen. In recent years, the decline in child mortality has slowed in South 
Asia, such that the regional gaps in child mortality have remained signifi cant. 
Increasingly, child mortality is concentrated in the poorest regions of the world, 
with sub-Saharan Africa (47 per cent) and South Asia (37 per cent) accounting 
for more than two thirds of all child deaths.

Child mortality, particularly neonatal mortality (death in the fi rst month of 
life), correlates strongly with the health and nutrition of the mother, as well 
as with the accessibility of both basic and emergency health services. There 
are very wide differences in the percentage of births attended by skilled health 
personnel, ranging from nearly 100 per cent in most advanced economies as 
well as in East and Central Asia, to only 50 per cent of deliveries in South 
Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (United Nations, 2013). Inequalities in nutritional 
intake, use of health-care services and access to infrastructural amenities are 
very important in determining disparities in child mortality.

Within countries, there is also a strong association between income, 
health outcomes and the use of health-care services, even in countries with 
comprehensive public-health programmes. On average, children in the lowest 
20 per cent of households by income in developing countries are three times 
less likely than those in wealthier households to have been delivered by skilled 
health personnel, nearly three times more likely to be underweight, and twice as 
likely to die before their fi fth birthday (United Nations, 2012; Case, Lubotsky 
and Paxson 2002; Cutler, Lleras-Muney and Vogl, 2008).  

Nutrition also remains an area of signifi cant global disparity. It is estimated 
that there has been reasonable progress globally in reducing the number and 
proportion of people undernourished, although most of the improvement has 
occurred in East and Southeast Asia (Food and Agriculture Organization of 
the United Nations (FAO), World Food Programme (WFP) and International 
Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), 2012; United Nations, 2013). The 
pace of change has been much slower in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa

which, considered together, are now estimated to account for the majority of all 
undernourished people in the world. Similarly, signifi cant disparities in hunger 
still persist within and across countries. While progress has been made against 
hunger over the past decade, the FAO estimated that 842 million people did 
not have access to adequate food in 2011-2013. Progress in reducing hunger 
has been relatively swift in South-Eastern Asia, Eastern Asia, the Caucasus and 
Central Asia, and Latin America, but hunger remains acute in South Asia and 
sub-Saharan Africa. Poor, or inadequate, nutrition is closely linked to poverty, 
and contributes to health and educational inequalities. For example, maternal 
malnutrition is linked to low birth weight and poor prenatal and postnatal health 
in mother and child. In 2011, an estimated 16 per cent of all children below the 
age of fi ve globally (some 101 million children) were underweight. In 1990, the 
number of underweight children stood at 159 million. 

Survey data on the proportion of children’s stunting (low height for age) 
also show large disparities between poor and rich households, both in countries 
with overall high levels of stunting and in countries with low levels (fi gure II.5). 
Disparities are particularly severe in Latin American countries such as Bolivia, 
Honduras and Peru, with the prevalence of stunting being nine times higher 
among children from poorer households compared to children from richer 
households. Differences across countries in stunting and malnutrition, however, 
are not necessarily correlated with each country’s income. For instance, 
Morocco and India are both lower-middle income countries, yet in Morocco, 
where disparities between income groups are smaller, average levels of stunting 
are three times lower than in India. Moreover, levels of stunting in Jordan are 
lower than in Colombia, even though income per capita is signifi cantly higher in 
the latter. These examples suggest that policy plays an important role in national 
health outcomes. 

Poor health during childhood has a strong impact on opportunities and 
outcomes over the life course. A longitudinal study conducted in Guatemala 
to assess the effects of stunting during childhood showed that stunted children, 
compared with non-stunted children who were given nutritional supplements 
during the fi rst 36 months of their lives, completed less schooling, scored lower 
on cognitive skills’ tests as adults, made less money and were less likely to be 
employed in higher-paying jobs (Hoddinott and others, 2011).

II. Inequalities in education

Educational achievement is a critical dimension of human well-being, not only 
in its own right but also as an important input to a person’s empowerment, 
capabilities and full participation in society. It is also a major driver of income 
and health outcomes. People who lack education or basic literacy skills face 
higher risks of ill-health and insecure employment, and are more likely to 
live in poverty. Education is one of the main determinants of future economic

opportunity, as there is a strong connection between levels of educational 
attainment and upward social and economic mobility. Investments in both 
the quality and quantity of education at all levels are, therefore, important for 
equalizing opportunities and reducing inequalities. Where declines in wage 
inequalities have been observed, these can be attributed largely to the expansion 
of coverage of basic and higher education (López-Calva and Lustig, 2010; 
Cornia, forthcoming). 

Despite the remarkable progress in expanding access to primary education 
around the world, the number of school-age children out of school remains 
staggering. In 2011, an estimated 57 million children of primary school age still 
were not enrolled in school, although the number was down from 102 million in 
2000 (UNESCO, 2012). More than half of those children reside in sub-Saharan 
Africa. Reducing inequality in education will, therefore, require getting those 
children into school and ensuring that they complete their schooling. UNESCO 
has estimated that one in four children who enter primary school will probably 
drop out before reaching the last grade of primary school. The persistence of 
high drop-out rates in developing countries is a key contributor to educational 
inequality. 

Differences between developed and developing countries in educational 
attainment, measured by average years of schooling, have declined in the last 50 
years due to the expansion of primary schooling worldwide. The average years 
of schooling among the global population aged over 15 years more than doubled,

from 3.12 years in 1950 to 7.9 years in 2010 (shown in fi gure II.6, based on a 
dataset for 146 countries). In developing countries, the average number of years 
of schooling increased from 2.0 years to 7.2 years, and the average rose from 
6.1 years to 11.3 years in advanced economies. Such improvements have been 
evident in all regions, with the greatest progress seen in the Middle East and 
North Africa, East Asia and the Pacifi c, and Europe and Central Asia. Primary-
school enrolment and completion rates among girls and boys have improved 
signifi cantly since the 1990s, as a result of the Millennium Development Goals 
campaign to achieve universal primary education and increase participation in 
post-primary education in developing countries.

As average educational levels have been increasing in all regions since the 
1950s, educational inequality within regions has been declining (fi gure II.7). 
A relatively new indicator used to access the distribution of human capital and 
welfare, the Gini coeffi cient of the distribution of school attainment for the world, 
declined from a high of 0.64 in 1950 to 0.34 in 2010, indicating that inequality in 
educational attainment has been declining in most countries. Educational Ginis 
are similar to the Gini coeffi cients used to measure the distribution of income 
or wealth. They range from 0, which represents perfect equality, to 1, which 
represents perfect inequality. The advanced countries have the lowest Gini index 
of education (0.19 in 2010), while the developing countries have seen a faster 
decline over the period (from 0.72 in 1950 to 0.37 in 2010). 

The largest regional declines in educational inequality occurred in East Asia 
and the Pacifi c, and in the Middle East and North Africa. Inequality has not fallen 
markedly in Europe and Central Asia, in part, because the region already had high 
average schooling levels and, hence, relatively low educational Gini coeffi cients, 
and had also reached gender parity in education over most of the period. Although 
gender gaps have been closing, in particular at the primary-school level, gender 
remains an important determinant of differences in educational attainment across 
the developing world. Sub-Saharan Africa has seen some of the greatest gains, 
with its ratio of years of schooling of females to males increasing from 67.2 per 
cent in 1990 to 80 per cent in 2010, although remaining well below parity. In both 
Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe and Central Asia, the gender ratios 
are now around 98 per cent, and in East Asia and the Pacifi c, the ratio is 88.3 per 
cent (Barro and Lee, 2012). The gender gap in education, as also evidenced by the 
fact that educational Gini for women tend to be much higher than those for men 
in most regions (see table II.1), accounts for much of the remaining inequality 
in education. Since forces underlying educational disparities often involve the 
interplay of structural, institutional, geographical, cultural and household factors, 
policies to reduce such disparities often vary across countries. Some common 
policies that have contributed to narrowing gender gaps in education include 
abolishing school fees, reducing costs, improving school facilities to make them 
‘girl-friendly’, purging school curriculums of gender biases, providing conditional 
cash transfers, and building rural infrastructure to reduce the amount of time rural 
women and girls spend collecting water and fi rewood.

The available evidence suggests that within-country disparities in education 
are also narrowing. An analysis of trends in educational inequality since the 
1970s, measured in years of schooling, shows declining disparities in most 
countries (UNDP, 2011). In contrast with trends in income inequality, within-
country educational inequality declined most in Europe and Central Asia, 
followed by Eastern Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean (ibid). 

Despite a general trend towards narrowing disparities, primary and secondary 
school attendance and completion still differ markedly within countries by 
wealth quintile, particularly at lower levels of attendance, as illustrated using 
recent data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for a sample of 19 
developing countries (fi gures II.8 and II.9).1  In Chad, for instance, only 9 per 
cent of children from the poorest households were attending primary school 
in 2004, compared with 63 per cent of children from the richest households. 
In most other sub-Saharan African countries shown in the fi gures, children 
from the poorest households were at least twice as likely to be out of school 
as children from the richest households. Even countries close to achieving 
universal primary education, such as Turkey and Viet Nam, have been unable to 
reach poorer children and retain them in school. In addition, higher attendance 
does not necessarily imply a smaller disparity. For instance, average primary 
school attendance is higher in Chad than in Burkina Faso and is also higher in 
Morocco than in Turkey. Yet children in the poorest quintile are out of school 
more often in Chad than in Burkina Faso, and more often in Morocco than in 
Turkey. 

1 In Demographic and Health Surveys, the proxy for wealth is a composite index of a 
household’s living standards, estimated by its ownership of selected durable assets (material 
used for construction, access to water and sanitation, and ownership of a television, a 
bicycle and other goods).

Inequality in key aspects of well-being 55

Household poverty has been found to be the single most important factor 
in keeping children out of school. An analysis of household surveys conducted 
in 63 developing countries between 2005 and 2011 found that children and 
adolescents from poorer households were at least three times more likely to be 
out of school than their richer counterparts (United Nations, 2013). Location 
and gender also matter. Rural children were nearly twice as likely as urban 
children to be out of school. Girls were more likely to be out of school than boys 
at both the primary and the secondary educational levels. Income and wealth 
also have a direct impact on educational outcomes, particularly in countries 
where education is not provided free of charge. They also affect education 
indirectly, as malnutrition, disease and lack of stimulation are heightened by 
household deprivation. All of these are factors that undermine the linguistic, 
cognitive and social skills that children develop even before entering school, 
and which form the foundations for lifelong learning and for economic as well 
as other opportunities. Additionally, family income and location are correlated 
signifi cantly with educational quality (UNESCO, 2010; 2011). Poor-quality 
education affects educational outcomes adversely and contributes to higher 
dropout rates among children living in poverty (Sabates and others, 2010). 

Barriers at the primary level are magnifi ed at the secondary level (fi gure II.9). 
Income disparities in secondary school attendance are larger in most countries 
than those observed in primary school, with the difference being greater where 
national average attendance is higher.  Distance to school, the opportunity costs 
of being in school and the quality of education all play larger roles in access 
to, and completion of, secondary education among poor groups, particularly 
in developing countries. Disparities in secondary and higher education are 
increasingly powerful forces driving inequalities, given that their roles are more 
and more vital in the development of the skills that are needed to participate in 
the global economy.

Although formal secondary schooling is the most effective means of 
acquiring work and life skills, young people in less-developed countries, rural 
or remote areas, and with socioeconomically disadvantaged or immigrant 
backgrounds, are more likely than others to be disadvantaged in access to 
secondary education. In developing countries, young adolescents from the 
poorest 20 per cent of households are three times more likely than those in the 
wealthiest 20 per cent of households to be out of school (United Nations, 2013). 
Young adolescents living in rural areas are 9 per cent more likely to be out of 
school than those living in urban areas. Moreover, young girls are more likely 
than their male counterparts to be out of school. In countries of the OECD, 
15-year-old students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, 
immigrant backgrounds or living in rural areas often perform less well than other 
students. These disadvantaged students are also more likely to attend schools 
that lack adequate resources and have less favourable teacher-to-student ratios. 

Despite the undisputed value of education, it should be borne in mind 
that it does not always provide a route out of poverty. School attendance and 



56 Inequality matters

completion do not necessarily refl ect adequate learning or job-preparedness, and 
access to productive employment and other assets is infl uenced by factors other 
than education. These facts illustrate the urgency of debates over the quality 
of education, learning outcomes and employment opportunities. As chapter 4 
explains, Governments of many countries and the international community are 
moving beyond expanding access to education as their only goal to focus on 
improving the quality of learning, thereby giving young people better skills to 
participate in the labour market. 

III. Spatial inequalities

Opportunity is strongly infl uenced by location. Where people are born and 
where they live have a lasting infl uence on their lifelong chances. While there is 
much heterogeneity across countries, spatial disparities are generally wide in all 
countries. Recent research indicates, for instance, that the poorest geographical 
regions of middle-income countries are, on average, as poor as low-income 
countries (Alkire, Roche and Seth, 2011). In Europe, intra-national disparities in 
educational attainment and achievement are often larger than disparities across 
countries (Ballas and others, 2012). Often, spatial inequalities account for a 
signifi cant proportion of within-country inequalities. They constitute more than 
half of total income inequality in China, for instance, and over 30 per cent in 
India (ADB, 2012). Although improvements in communications technologies and 
reductions in transportation costs are reducing effective distances, on average, 
such improvements are not universal. In many developing countries, poor 
infrastructure, coupled with high transportation costs and congestion, makes even 
short distances diffi cult to travel for the majority of the population. 

A. Disparities between urban and rural areas

In addition to geography, the unequal distribution of public and private assets is 
an important determinant of spatial disparities, which are particularly noteworthy 
between urban and rural areas. Natural resource endowments and location are 
drivers of the concentration of investment, employment opportunities and people. 
At the same time, the spatial concentration of activity leads to effi ciency gains, 
economies of scale and further agglomeration. Thus, productivity tends to be 
higher in urban areas, and agglomeration reinforces the comparative advantage 
of cities. In addition to such advantages, urban residents have, on average, better 
access to education and health care – as well as to other basic services such 
as safe drinking water, basic sanitation, transportation and communication – 
than rural populations. For instance, in developing countries, 73 per cent of 
urban dwellers, and only 33 per cent of the rural population, had access to basic 
sanitation facilities in 2004 (WHO and UNICEF, 2006). Salaries and returns to 
assets are often higher in urban areas because of higher productivity, as well as 
better infrastructure and services.

58 Inequality matters

The evidence showing that poverty is higher in rural than in urban areas 
is broad. According to the World Bank, 75 per cent of those living in extreme 
income poverty resided in rural areas in 2002, despite the fact that only about 
52 per cent of the world population were living in such areas (Ravallion, Chen 
and Sangraula, 2007). Based on more recent estimates of the Multidimensional 
Poverty Index (MPI), which considers overlapping deprivations in education, 
health and living standards, the greatest incidence of MPI poverty is still in rural 
rather than in urban areas of all developing countries with data (fi gure II.10), 
even in those countries where the overall prevalence of poverty is low - such as 
in the Central Asian countries shown in fi gure II.10. 

Rural populations also receive lesser returns to human capital investments 
(Kanbur and Venables, 2005). The urban-rural gap in health, education, and 
other skills and household endowments, is compounded by factors such as wage 
differentials and employment opportunities (Nguyen and others, 2007). Such 
compound disadvantages, together with social and political exclusion, make 
rural populations more likely to experience long-term poverty in what it is often 
referred to as spatial poverty traps (Bird, Higgins and Harris, 2010; UN-Habitat, 
2010). 

B.  An enduring rural-urban divide?

Despite persistent rural disadvantages, evidence from surveys suggests that 
improvements in education, health and nutrition during the last decade have often 
been achieved faster in rural rather than in urban areas of developing countries. 
According to Sumner (2012), progress in these dimensions in urban areas was 
very limited between the late 1990s and the late 2000s, with levels of education 
and health even declining in some large cities. DHS data for 33 developing 
countries showed, for instance, that the proportion of children underweight in 
rural areas declined from 30.7 per cent in the late 1990s to 28.3 per cent in the 
late 2000s while remaining almost constant, although at much lower levels–6.4 
and 6.2 per cent–in urban areas (Sumner, 2012). Günther and Harttgen (2012) 
found that, in sub-Saharan Africa, adult mortality rose in urban areas, from an 
average 124.5 per thousand in the 1990s to 141.1 per thousand in the late 2000s, 
while declining in rural areas.

However, trends do vary signifi cantly across countries. Rising urban-
rural inequalities in China during the last few decades have been widely 
documented. The uneven distribution of economic growth, poverty reduction 
and public investment to the benefi t of cities and industrial development resulted 
in signifi cant increases in the absolute gap between urban and rural incomes 
between the early 1980s and the mid-2000s (Chaudhuri and Ravallion, 2006; 
Whyte, 2010). China’s system of household registration (the hukou system), 
which restricts internal migration severely, has contributed to this income gap 
through the marginalization of rural residents and rural-to-urban migrants 
(Wang, 2010; Chan, 2011). Recent efforts by the central and local governments 



Inequality in key aspects of well-being 59

to reduce inequalities and stimulate rural growth, through regional development 
plans, the reduction in regressive taxes and fees in rural areas, increased public 
investment in rural infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, in social services, as 
well as some initial attempts to reform the hukou system, may have started to 
bear fruit (Whyte, 2010; OECD 2010a). Namely, annual income growth in rural 
areas increased from 4 per cent in the early 2000s to over 8 per cent in 2006-
2008, a growth rate similar to that registered in urban areas (Sun, 2010). OECD 
estimates indicate that the rise in inequality may have started to level off in 
2005, with some indicators even showing declines in spatial inequality since 
2006  (OECD, 2010a). Whether this apparent decline is the beginning of a long-
term trend remains to be seen, particularly taking into account the country’s 
economic slowdown in 2011 and 2012.

While most evidence regarding spatial disparities is highly aggregated and 
generally compares only major sub-national regions, or urban to rural areas, the 
economic and social landscape of cities and rural areas is very heterogeneous. 
Although spatial segregation or exclusion, be it by income, ethnic or national 
background, religion or other factors, is common to many cities, the way in which 
a population is spatially distributed differs by city and by country.2 

C. Disparities within urban areas 

Despite the comparative advantage of cities, urban areas are more unequal than 
rural areas. Firstly, social and economic conditions vary by city size. In general, 
larger cities (usually defi ned as those with a population of one million or over) 
are better served than smaller cities and towns in terms of social services and 
infrastructure, including safe drinking water, sanitation and electricity (National 
Research Council, 2003). Moreover, a comparison of large and small cities 
across 90 developing countries showed that adults in larger cities had more 
schooling than those in smaller cities (ibid., fi gure V.6). 

Secondly, within most cities and towns, high levels of wealth and modern 
infrastructure coexist with areas characterized by severe deprivation and lack of 
services in what UN-Habitat called the ‘urban divide’ (UN-Habitat, 2010).  Such 
a divide has economic, social and political dimensions. Economically, the Gini 
coeffi cient of income is larger in cities than in rural areas in the large majority of 
developed and developing countries, with the important exception of China (ibid.). 
Socially, rapid rates of urbanization combined with inadequate infrastructure have 
led to growing concerns about deteriorating health conditions in urban areas. The 
evidence available on intra-urban disparities suggests that the health disadvantages

suffered by the urban poor differ little from those experienced by rural residents. 
In a study of 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Günther and Harttgen (2012) 
found that child mortality rates in urban slums were, on average, 1.65 times higher 
than in other urban areas. In three of these countries, child mortality was even 
higher in slums than in rural areas. In India, 52.6 per cent of urban children in the 
bottom wealth decile were stunted in 2000, while stunting affected only 26.1 per 
cent of urban children in the top half of the urban distribution and 40.8 per cent 
of rural children in the top half (Montgomery, 2009). Stunting was only slightly 
higher among rural children in the bottom decile (57.2 per cent) than among poor 
urban children (52.6 per cent). Similar disparities were found in Egypt and other 
developing countries in these and other indicators of maternal and child health 
(Montgomery, 2009). Thus, although there is an urban health advantage, health 
disparities are larger in urban than in rural areas, and the burden of disease borne 
by the urban poor is similar to that borne by rural populations.

Despite the advantages conferred by closer proximity to modern health 
care and other services in urban areas, such services may lie beyond the reach 
of people living in poverty due to economic constraints or other reasons. For 
example, poor households may lack the information or the agency needed to 
seek health care. In addition, poor city dwellers often live in close proximity to 
health services yet lack access to basic sanitation or safe drinking water, thereby 
facing a higher risk of contracting communicable diseases. The urban poor, 
especially those resident in slums, receive less water and sanitation services and 
electricity than other urban residents (National Research Council, 2003).

Many of the urban poor still live in poor-quality settlements or slums, 
where unmet basic needs—in terms of housing, infrastructure and services—are 
greatest, despite Millennium Development Goals achievements. In developing 
regions as a whole, the proportion of slum dwellers to the total urban population 
decreased from 39 per cent in 2000 to 33 per cent in 2012, due to the expanded 
provision of improved water sources, sanitation facilities, durable houses and 
suffi cient living space (United Nations, 2013). The largest decreases were in 
Asia, where less than one third of urban residents are now considered to be 
living in slums. However, slum dwellers in sub-Saharan Africa still account for 
around 62 per cent of that region’s urban population.  

Slums are the clearest symptom of a divided city, yet urban poverty is found 
outside of slums as well. In India, the proportion of the population below the 
offi cial poverty line was 44 per cent in areas offi cially classifi ed as slums, close to 
52 per cent in non-notifi ed slums, and 23 per cent in other urban neighbourhoods 
(Chandrasekhar and Montgomery, 2010). In addition, over one quarter of 
households in slum areas have expenditure that is above the offi cial poverty 
line, suggesting that many households in the slums are not poor—or, rather, that 
the offi cial poverty line is set too low (ibid.). The challenges for slum dwellers 
arise from inadequate infrastructure, poor housing, hazardous location, social 
and economic exclusion, violence and insecurity. Slum dwellers are, therefore, 
disempowered on account of their location and are often discriminated against 



Inequality in key aspects of well-being 61

in employment and access to public services. Like rural populations, urban slum 
dwellers are also victims of ‘spatial poverty traps’ due to their social, economic 
and political exclusion, which results in a severe waste of human potential. 

Politically, persons from low-income households in both urban and rural 
areas have little or no political voice or formal representation, particularly if 
they live in settlements with no legal address. Differences in power, infl uence 
and access can help reinforce the urban divide and tilt public investment towards 
the interests of the elite. In addition, political voice can be controlled through 
relationships that trade access to benefi ts for electoral support. In Nairobi, for 
instance, 41 per cent of landlords in informal settlements in 2002 were found to 
be Government offi cials and 16 per cent elected politicians; many ran lucrative 
businesses on the side, selling water and access to sanitary facilities (Syagga, 
Mitullah and Karirah-Gitau, 2002). In Karachi, municipal offi cials provided 
water tankers with access to public water supplies, which were then sold at 
much higher prices (Rahman, 2008). 

IV. Conclusion

Despite a general trend towards narrowing the disparities in life expectancy, 
child health and mortality, and primary and secondary school attendance and 
completion, health and educational outcomes still differ markedly across, and 
within, countries.  Opportunities and children’s futures depend strongly on 
income, wealth and place of residence. As with economic inequalities, trends 
vary signifi cantly across countries and regions. Some countries have done better 
than others at closing human development gaps. Domestic policy measures, 
supported by international cooperation, have made a difference. However, 
shrinking inequalities are not always the outcome of widespread progress: in 
some countries, for instance, urban health indicators have stagnated—or even 
worsened—while rural health has improved.  

As the international community shapes its vision for the development 
agenda after 2015, it is important to emphasize that addressing inequality is 
not merely a moral imperative. It is also necessary to unleash the full potential 
of each country’s population and to bring development onto a sustainable path. 
Indeed, as the next chapter shows, there is growing evidence and recognition of 
the powerful and corrosive effects of inequality on poverty reduction, economic 
growth, social cohesion and stability.

Chapter 3

The impact of inequality

The previous chapters showed that, both within and across countries, the rich have 
gained disproportionately from the economic growth of the past two decades. 
This rising inequality matters, not only for its effect on economic development 
processes, but also for its impact on poverty reduction, social mobility, social 
cohesion, political stability, and other aspects of social development. However, 
as highlighted in previous chapters, the arguments and evidence against 
inequality as an unavoidable by-product of development are growing. While 
some level of inequality can be incentivizing, there is growing recognition that 
too much inequality, and sustained periods of it, can derail economic progress 
and deepen—or create—the social and economic exclusion of large pockets of 
society. 

This chapter discusses the real and potential impacts of inequality on 
socioeconomic development. While it accepts that moderate levels of inequality 
can have a constructive infl uence, it illustrates the—mostly constraining—
impact of inequality in relation to economic growth, poverty, social mobility, 
social stability and cohesion. 

I.  Inequality and economic growth 

The relationship between inequality and growth is complex. Ongoing efforts 
to understand this relationship in the development literature are yielding 
mixed results. Some studies have found a positive relationship between the 
two phenomena, while others have found either a negative relationship or no 
relationship at all. Consequently, a number of important policy questions have 
emerged. These include whether inequality is harmful to economic growth, 
whether growth is good for the poor, and whether highly unequal societies 
experience slower economic growth than more egalitarian ones. 

Inequality has shown itself to be useful, to some degree, in ensuring the 
effi ciency of the economy, which enhances growth. Okun (1975) argued that 
pursuing equality could reduce economic effi ciency. This scenario sees some 
level of inequality as constructive, stimulating capital accumulation and 
technological innovation and creating incentives to invest in education and 



64 Inequality matters

health. This suggests that more equal distribution of incomes could reduce 
incentives to work and invest. This argument also points out that efforts to 
redistribute incomes through minimum wages, taxation and other public policies 
can be costly. However, with the onset, and lasting effects, of the recent global 
fi nancial and economic crisis, greater attention is being given to the negative 
long-term impact of rising inequality, and to the role of fi scal and social policy 
in shaping and curbing these effects. 

High levels of inequality can be a serious impediment to future economic 
growth and a potential cause of underdevelopment (Berg, Ostry, and Zettelmeyer, 
2012; Easterly 2002; Bruno, Ravallion and Squire, 1996; Alesina and Rodrik, 
1994). Berg and Ostry (2011) examined the relationship between income 
inequality and economic growth across 174 countries, to reveal that income 
inequality was a strong determinant of the quality of growth, even when market 
structure and other institutional factors were taken into account. Countries with 
low levels of inequality tend to sustain high rates of growth for longer durations, 
while growth spurts tend to fade more quickly in more unequal countries. 
Similarly, growth in more unequal countries can be much slower than that in 
countries with low initial levels of inequality (Bénabou, 1996). 

In addition to inhibiting economic growth over time, inequality can also 
generate greater market volatility and instability. One of the important ways in 
which inequality has created economic instability is through its impact on the 
generation of fi nance-driven business cycles (Galbraith, 2012). Some evidence 
of this has been seen in the much-debated relationship between inequality and 
the onset of economic recession. Both the Great Depression of the 1930s and 
the 2007-2008 Great Recession were preceded by sharp increases in income and 
wealth inequality and by a rapid rise in debt-to-income ratios among lower- and 
middle-income households (Kumhof and Rancière, 2010)

While the relationship is not clear-cut, there are persuasive arguments that 
it was the combination of growing inequality, wage stagnation and fi nancial 
deregulation that fuelled the global fi nancial crisis of 2008-2009 (Foster and 
Magdoff, 2009; Galbraith, 2012; Stiglitz, 2012; Stockhammer, 2012; Rohit, 
2013). In the years prior to the crisis, the poor (who consume a relatively greater 
share of their income) had falling shares of national income. Rising inequality 
reduced aggregate demand and slowed economic growth. The fi nancial sector 
and economic stimulus policies sought to counter reduced spending and 
economic stagnation with so-called fi nancial innovations and easy credit, which 
led to increased debt-driven consumption, particularly among poor and middle-
income households in the advanced economies of the United States of America 
and Europe. As a result, poor and middle-class households accumulated 
unsustainable debt. Household debt in the United States rose from around 50 per 
cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the early 1980s to nearly 100 per cent 
in 2007, and to 130 per cent of disposable income (Papadimitriou, Hannsgen 
and Zezza, 2008; Krugman, 2010). Not surprisingly, with this increased debt 
came a decline in savings among the poor and middle classes, feeding further 



The impact of inequality 65

demand for, and supply of, credit to these same households. As rich households 
tend to hold riskier fi nancial assets than other income groups, there was a 
further concentration of income and wealth at the top of the income distribution 
ranking. The expansion of hedge funds and subprime derivatives, associated 
with the rising demand for credit increased, not only the incomes of the super-
rich but also, aggregate speculation (Stiglitz, 2012; Lucchino and Morelli, 2012; 
Rajan, 2010; Reich, 2010). This combination of forces created the unsustainable 
process of expansion in the United States and other developed countries in 
Europe that culminated in the fi nancial crisis. 

The complex relationship between inequality and growth is also illustrated 
by the potential of economic crises to create, or deepen, inequalities. The fi nancial 
and economic crisis impacted many countries by increasing their fi scal defi cits, 
limiting their policy space and their capacity to respond to future shocks. In 
particular, the crisis also spurred the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, to which 
policymakers have responded by implementing austerity measures. This has not 
only decreased growth rates in Europe but has affected other economies through 
reduced trade and aid. 

With the declining revenues fuelled by the crisis, many Governments have 
been unable to maintain, or increase, public spending in critical areas, including 
those that affect livelihoods and living conditions. The less well off have been 
disproportionately affected, hit heavily by job losses and income declines (ILO, 
2013a). 

In many countries, the increase in part-time work in comparison with full-
time work, and reductions in overtime, has resulted in fewer total working 
hours, exacerbating a phenomenon that existed before the crisis. In Europe, 
temporary workers have felt the brunt of labour-market adjustments. Ninety 
per cent of employment losses in Spain were among temporary workers 
(Vaughan-Whitehead, 2012). Across the region, and in many other advanced 
economies, rising unemployment has put downward pressure on real wages, 
reducing consumption further. Bulgaria, Hungary and the United Kingdom have 
experienced increases in wage differentials between the top and bottom of the 
wage scale. Aggregate statistics may hide the actual depth of the effect of the 
crisis on income-inequality, as lower-waged, low-skilled and temporary workers 
may be laid off fi rst, leaving better-paid workers employed at higher aggregate 
wages (ILO,2013b). In emerging and developing economies, structural change 
has slowed since the crisis, as jobs are not moving from low- to higher-
productivity sectors as fast as they had before. This has slowed progress in 
reducing vulnerable employment and the number of working poor.

The mixed impact of the recent crisis on inequality and growth highlights 
further the importance of social and fi scal policy in shaping the effects of 
growth on poverty reduction, social mobility and social cohesion. Chapter 1 
showed that many countries in Latin America, several in Africa and a few in 
Asia experienced declines in income inequality between 2003 and 2010. In most 



66 Inequality matters

of those countries, proactive public policies played a critical role in ensuring 
that the crisis did not harm the population in the bottom half of the distribution 
disproportionately. The following sections discuss some of the social impacts of 
inequality, and show that policy matters, critically.

II.  Inequality and poverty

Inequality, and its relationship with growth, have marked implications for 
poverty reduction, and vice versa. Income and non-income inequalities shape 
the responsiveness of poverty to income growth. Inequalities also undermine 
the growth process by excluding people living in poverty from sharing the 
benefi ts of growth (Ravallion, 2011; Adigun, Awoyemi and Omonona, 2011; 
Adams, 2003; Easterly, 2000; Kakwani, 1993). Lack of opportunities for 
building human capabilities, such as limited access to quality education and 
health care, can contribute to rising inequality, and limit social and economic 
mobility. Similarly, unequal access to other tangible productive assets, such 
as agricultural land, contributes to rising, or persistently high, inequality, by 
limiting the ability of some to share fully in the benefi ts of growth. In turn, 
these developments can lower growth rates, as argued in the preceding section. 
The quality of institutions and the nature of social policies pursued by countries 
are, therefore, important in determining the ultimate level and direction of both 
inequalities of opportunity and of income.

As illustrated by fi gure III.1, the inequality-poverty-growth nexus is one of co-
dependence. While accelerated economic growth is a primary factor in reducing 
poverty, inequalities can constrain poverty reduction signifi cantly. Without a 
change in the distribution of income, poverty reduction is only possible with 
growth. However, growth is less effective in reducing poverty in high-inequality 
countries, even when the distribution does not worsen; and, low levels of initial 
inequality, or modest reductions, can have relatively large poverty-reducing effects 
(Bourguignon, 2004). Grammy and Assane (2006) showed that improvement in 
income distribution was the key channel for poverty reduction. Using data on 
sixty-six developing countries over the periods 1970-1979, 1980-1989 and 1990-
1998, they noted that growth accompanied by improved distribution worked better 
than either growth or distribution alone, and that provision of civil liberties and 
political rights enabled people to participate more actively in reducing poverty.

The pace of poverty reduction also tends to be much faster in more egalitarian 
countries and in countries in which lower initial levels of inequality have been 
followed by sustained growth spurts. Conversely, poverty-reduction efforts 
have been observed to falter in countries with large inequalities, weak growth 
or inadequate social protection programmes (Fosu, 2011; Besley and Burgess, 
2003; White and Anderson, 2001; Bruno, Ravallion and Squire 1996). Yet, as 
highlighted earlier, redistribution without competitive economic incentives 
can undermine productivity and economic growth. The relationship between 
inequality, growth and poverty thus strikes a delicate balance. Prioritizing 



The impact of inequality 67

growth alone is not suffi  cient for poverty reduction. In order to reduce poverty 
effectively and sustainably, growth must be combined with sustained investments 
in human capital, such as education and health, and food and nutrition security, 
that keep income and non-income inequalities at constructive levels. 

Figure III.1. The growth-inequality-poverty triangle

The experience of poverty reduction in East Asia is often cited as a counter-
argument to the need for curbing inequalities. Over the past 30 to 40 years, some 
East Asian countries have managed to achieve rapid poverty reduction despite 
rising inequality. In China, for example, very rapid output growth (at an annual 
rate of around 9 per cent - 10 per cent between 1981 and 2005) was associated 
with dramatic declines in poverty (at an estimated annual rate of 6.6 per cent 
over the same period), even though inequality measured by the Gini index rose 
from 0.16 in 1980 to about 0.48 in 2011. However, inequality in both assets and 
incomes in China was extremely low at the start of the high growth phase, and 
this was probably critical to enabling rapid income growth. Further, poverty 
declined most sharply in the early 1980s and the mid-1990s, both of which 
were periods of falling inequality (particularly rural-urban income inequality). 
Increased income to farmers was crucial in reducing aggregate poverty at these 
points (Ghosh, 2010). Without rising inequality, the high rates of growth in 
China would have translated into even higher poverty reduction (Ravallion, 
2011; Fosu, 2011).

The cross-country variations in growth and inequality presented in Chapter 
1 underscore the complex linkages between growth, inequality and poverty 
reduction. They are a refl ection of the different macroeconomic and social 



68 Inequality matters

policies that countries have (or have not) implemented in order to stimulate 
growth, foster structural transformation, create employment opportunities, widen 
access to basic opportunities in education, health and job training, and deepen 
social provisioning. Addressing inequalities requires a combination of growth-
enhancing, employment-generating macroeconomic policies and redistributive 
social policies. A focus on only one set of policies is likely to maximize impact 
on either poverty reduction or lowering inequalities, but not, necessarily, on both. 
However, tying redistributive policies too tightly to growth policies, or equity 
objectives too closely to growth objectives, would be a major mistake (McKinley, 
2009). Greater equity should be valued as an end in itself—not primarily as a 
means that could advance the cause of growth. Redistributive policies, therefore, 
need to be addressed in their own right. 

III. Inequality and social mobility

The relationship between inequality, poverty and growth can also manifest itself 
through the ease—or diffi culty—with which individuals are able to move up 
the socioeconomic ladder, and live better lives in relation to their parents. This 
intergenerational socioeconomic mobility refl ects the dynamic impact of inequality. 
The degree of mobility within a country is an indicator of the distribution of access 
to opportunities for building human capabilities, and of the extent to which people 
can move ahead based on their abilities and efforts. 

One measure of socioeconomic mobility is the relationship between the 
incomes of parents and children. Limited income mobility would mean that all 
children born to poor parents would be poor as adults, and all children born to 
rich parents would become rich adults, regardless of their innate potential or 
efforts. The intergenerational earnings elasticity (IEE) of a given society is a 
measure of the fl uidity or rigidity of this relationship. IEE ranges from 0 (total 
mobility) to 1 (no mobility) and, as illustrated by the phenomenon known as ‘the 
Great Gatsby Curve’ (Kreuger, 2012), is affected signifi cantly by initial levels of 
inequality (Corak, 2013, fi gure 2). Although data differences make inter-country 
comparisons tenuous, Corak (2013) shows that higher levels of inequality are 
associated with less intergenerational mobility. Developing countries also show 
less income mobility than developed countries, a trend that may be related to the 
comparatively fewer opportunities for improving human capacity in developing 
countries, such as access to quality education, health care and decent work.

Recent studies fi nd some support for a link between rising inequality and 
declining mobility in the United States and the United Kingdom (Blanden, Gregg 
and Machin, 2005; Bradbury, 2011). As income inequality in the United States has 
increased, family income mobility has declined, and the link has become stronger 
with time (Bradbury, 2011). A similar situation was found in Britain, when 
comparing income mobility of children born in 1958, versus a group born in 1970 
(Blanden, Gregg and Machin, 2005). While less is known about intergenerational 



The impact of inequality 69

income mobility in developing countries, studies in Latin America have shown 
strong links between the socioeconomic status of parents and that of their children 
(Grawe, 2004; Dunn, 2007; Nunez and Miranda, 2010). In many countries, 
parental wealth has a substantial effect on children’s education, occupational 
status, consumption, and wealth later in life (Torche and Costa-Ribeiro, 2012). 

The structure of inequality in terms of the varying concentration of 
households along the income distribution also affects the degree of income 
mobility in a given country. There are fewer opportunities for mobility in those 
countries characterized by smaller middle classes, more people concentrated at 
the bottom of the income distribution and fewer at the top. There tends to be less 
mobility at the very top and bottom of the income distribution, as the very poor 
are less likely to move up while the extremely wealthy are less vulnerable to 
downward mobility and more likely hold on to their positions (d’Addio, 2007). 

Education is an important channel for socioeconomic mobility. Countries 
with higher overall levels of education tend to have higher intergenerational 
mobility (Filmer and Pritchett, 1999; Behrman, Birdsall and Szekely, 2000; 
Dahan and Gaviria, 2001).  In Latin America, a region with otherwise very high 
inequalities, a main determinant of the fall in wage inequality over the 2000s was 
the increase in secondary enrolment and completion rates that began in the early 
1990s and accelerated during the 2000s. This trend benefi ted children from low-
income families in particular (Cruces, Domench and Gasparini, forthcoming). 
In the Republic of Korea, rapid educational expansion led by public spending 
contributed to high educational mobility. Forty-fi ve per cent of the 1970-to-1985 
birth cohort whose fathers did not achieve high-school diplomas received at 
least some college education, and 59 per cent of women had received some 
college education by 2005 (Kye, 2011). 

In turn, socioeconomic background infl uences educational attainment in 
several ways. Children from disadvantaged families may receive less parental 
and domestic support and cognitive stimulation, live in poorer neighbourhoods, 
experience worse health outcomes, and have other confl icting pressures such as 
contributing to family income or housework-related tasks. Studies have found 
that, even by the age of fi ve, substantive gaps have emerged in the cognitive 
and non-cognitive skills of children from different socioeconomic backgrounds. 
These gaps have a tendency to widen over time as less advantaged children 
encounter more barriers to choice, such as: the need to opt out of school and join 
the workforce to contribute to the household, inability to pay school fees, and 
lack of access to quality schools (Bradbury and others, 2012; Heckman, 2006). 

As will be discussed in Chapter 4, membership in a particular ethnic 
group, class, gender, or having other social characteristics can heighten 
educational disadvantage and upward mobility. For example, Majumder (2010) 
found intergenerational educational mobility in India to be much lower for 
disadvantaged and excluded groups than for advanced classes. Similarly, in South 
Africa, Nimubona and Vencatachellum (2007) found that the intergenerational 



70 Inequality matters

educational mobility of black Africans was lower than of white Africans, with the 
poorest groups experiencing the lowest levels of mobility.  

Educational attainment and social and economic mobility are clearly 
interrelated, and policies to address disparities in education need to bear this 
in mind. Education can mediate the association between the socioeconomic 
status of parents and that of their children, a persistence present in many country 
settings (Hertz, 2008). As Chapter 5 highlights, policies to promote universal 
quality education are important. However, in order for educational access to 
translate into improved social and economic outcomes across generations, 
attention to household support structures is important, as well as attention to the 
discrimination and social exclusion creating the socioeconomic traps in which 
some families are caught.

Health outcomes are also integral to intergenerational upward mobility. Good 
health is an important precondition for the development of other capabilities that 
can enable socioeconomic mobility, such as education and labour productivity. 
Poor health can limit individual socioeconomic prospects and, ultimately, 
perpetuate—or even contribute to—increases in income and non-income 
inequality. Children in poor health may have greater diffi culty learning, leave 
school earlier than healthy children, and tend to become less healthy adults. 
Adults in poor health may have diffi culty fi nding, or holding, good jobs. They 
may not be able to work as many hours, or at the same productivity level, as their 
healthier peers, resulting in lower wages (Case and Paxson, 2006). Conversely, 
there is a clear relationship between poverty and the increased likelihood of poor 
health (Adamson, 2010). Policies to promote investment in health thus form an 
important component of any strategy to facilitate socioeconomic mobility.

IV. Social and political cohesion, social tolerance of inequality

Besides its close relationship with social mobility, inequality also matters for social 
and political cohesion and social tolerance. Under certain conditions, inequality 
can contribute to social instability and undermine trust. This is particularly the 
case where the gap between rich and poor is large and continuing to grow. 

The upsurge in inequality in many parts of the world is generating divergent 
life experiences and societal expectations between the affl uent and other 
social groups. The result has been greater social stratifi cation and residential 
segregation. As the wealthy retreat from broad civic engagement and insulate 
themselves from the social and economic costs imposed by rising inequality on 
the broader society, they are less likely to be concerned about the plight of the 
less fortunate. The rich, individually or in associations such as business lobbies 
and other groups, may also engage in unproductive or predatory activities that 
add to inequality, and may be further detrimental to growth and economic and 
fi nancial stability. This includes political lobbying to increase further their share 
of existing wealth through regulatory capture and by infl uencing the formulation 



The impact of inequality 71

and application of rules to their own advantage. Such behaviour weakens social 
trust and the social compact between groups further, and makes it much more 
diffi cult to forge common political solutions and social policies that promote 
investment in areas such as education, health and social protection (Oxendine, 
2009; Costa and Kahn, 2002; Kawachi and others, 1997; Massey, 1996).

The denial of political voice or infl uence among those at the lower end of 
the inequality spectrum can cause social tensions, political instability, and even, 
violent confl ict. People grow frustrated when they perceive that opportunities to 
improve their own lives are inaccessible, and the resultant protests can also lead 
to social unrest. This has shown itself in the wave of demonstrations seen around 
the world in response to the economic and fi nancial crises and austerity measures, 
and in the social and political protests in the Middle East and North Africa. 
The discontent has not necessarily been always related to the absolute level of 
inequality, but to a combination of rising expectations and limited opportunities. 
For example, in Tunisia, high levels of educational attainment coupled with the 
lack of employment and decent work opportunities were critical factors fuelling 
the tensions (Campante and Chor, 2012). Similarly, the recent public protests in 
Brazil that involved workers, students, middle-class professionals and others, 
not only refl ected continued inequalities, but expressed a wide range of demands 
about public service provision and corruption, refl ecting the rapid growth of 
expectations in a dynamic country (Saad-Filho, 2013). 

The relationship between income inequality and confl ict is complex. Poorer 
countries tend to have more confl ict than wealthier countries (Collier, 2007),  
and in highly unequal societies, both rich and poor groups are in confl ict more 
often than groups whose wealth lies closer to the country average. Furthermore, 
horizontal inequalities between ethnic groups and States can promote confl ict 
(Cederman, Weidmann and Gleditsch, 2011). Local economic characteristics 
also matter for confl ict: civil confl icts are more likely to erupt in areas with 
low absolute income, even if a country’s gross domestic product per capita is 
not necessarily low, and in areas with large deviations from national averages 
(Buhaug and others, 2011).

Inequality is more likely to be perceived as acceptable where all 
individuals have equal opportunity to improve their socioeconomic position, 
and where those at the upper end of the income continuum have achieved their 
position through merit rather than inherited advantage. As a result, when the 
level of Government investment in education, health, public transport and 
social security increases, the likelihood of the onset of civil confl ict declines 
signifi cantly (Taydas and Peksen, 2012).When privileged elites use institutions, 
public resources and access to assets, such as land, to maintain their status, 
they impose tremendous social and economic costs on society – creating 
conditions which not only weaken economic growth, constrain the fi nancial 
development of countries and foster long-term inequality, but also contribute 
to social exclusion and political instability (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012; 
Roe and Siegel, 2011; Sokoloff and Engerman, 2000). Furthermore, social and 



72 Inequality matters

economic inequalities reinforce disparities in political participation and, as a 
result, ethnic minorities, women, indigenous people, youth and other affected 
social groups tend to have signifi cantly lower rates of political participation. 
However, ethnic-minority participation and representation has been increasing 
in many liberal democracies (Bird, Saalfeld and Wüst, 2010). Similarly, gender 
inequality in political participation is declining, albeit slowly, worldwide (Coffé 
and Bolzendahl, 2011). Despite such improvements however, all regions are 
still well below equality in the engagement of all social and economic groups in 
activities intended to infl uence Government decision-making. 

The media play an important role in shaping how inequality is seen and 
addressed. There is evidence that the extent of media freedom in democracies 
is positively associated with spending on health and education, net of the 
overall level of development (Petrova, 2008). Media control can also lead to 
manipulation of public opinion in ways that perpetuate, or increase, inequalities. 
High inequality is associated with elite capture of media and lower media 
freedom, particularly in democracies. A study on the way in which tax cuts in the 
United States were presented to the public in the early 2000s showed how media 
framing of the issue may have led to support for the cuts by the majority of 
citizens. This occurred even though the benefi ts were heavily concentrated at the 
very top of the income and wealth distributions, and although the implications 
– in terms of reduced public spending in other areas–were often against 
individuals’ own economic interests and widely-shared collective values (Bell 
and Entman, 2011). Another study on the United States found that media outlets 
largely ignored economic inequality in discussions about the overall economy, 
despite mounting evidence suggesting that the problem had increased in recent 
years (Kleine, 2013). 

Social media play a new role in this context, and the rapidly changing 
nature of media business and coverage suggests that traditional forms of elite 
capture can be both undermined and reinforced by the new social media. It 
is harder to infl uence the content and perspectives of major media providers 
amidst so many alternative sources of information. It is also harder to prevent 
different—and more pluralistic—forms of expression that can inform those who 
would otherwise remain unaware of actual trends, including in inequalities, and 
how policies can affect them.  However, the digital divide remains large, albeit 
narrowing, even in developing countries where mobile telephony is fulfi lling 
many of the earlier functions of personal computers. Moreover, blogging and 
similar forms of media interaction are still strongly class-driven (Schradie 
2012), even as race and ethnicity become less important as determinants. 



The impact of inequality 73

V.  Conclusion

The many adverse consequences of inequality affect not only those at the lower 
end of the distribution, but also those who would seem to be benefi ting from 
it. The onset—and continued impact—of the recent fi nancial and economic 
crisis highlights the damage that inequalities can do to social and economic 
development. Inequality leads to less stable, ineffi cient economic systems 
that restrain economic growth and pose a serious barrier to the eradication of 
poverty. This, in turn, reduces the contribution of economic growth to social 
development and reduces social mobility.

Given the complex linkages between inequality, growth and poverty 
reduction, macroeconomic and social policies must aim at stimulating growth, 
fostering structural transformation and deepening social provisioning. All 
individuals, irrespective of their background, should have a fair shot at economic 
success. Accessing those opportunities that nurture their talents and abilities is 
critical. 

Rising inequality can have a particularly profound impact on specifi c 
groups within societies. Various social groups – such as youth, older persons, 
persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and rural populations – suffer 
disproportionally from inequality. Chapter 4 elaborates on how the disparities 
associated with these social groups intersect with, and reinforce, each other.

Chapter 4

Identi ty and inequality: Focus on 
social groups

The previous chapters have shown that factors beyond an individual’s skill or 
effort, such as place of residence or parents’ education, affect income, access to 
other productive assets, and health and educational status, thus creating inequality 
between individuals. Yet other characteristics that identify the social group to 
which an individual belongs, including gender, age, and migrant, indigenous or 
disability status, also have considerable infl uence on well-being and economic 
outcomes. Indeed, an individual’s chances in life depend signifi cantly on group 
ascription and the ways in which both the individual and group interacts with 
public institutions and the labour market. 

It is important to address group inequalities, because they constitute a large 
component of overall inequalities within countries (United Nations Research 
Institute for Social Development, 2010). Disadvantaged groups often have lower 
levels of human capital due to factors such as place of residence, lack of social 
capital or discrimination, and may receive lesser returns on such investments than 
other groups. Furthermore, unequal access to resources can affect the well-being 
of the individuals belonging to disadvantaged groups adversely in comparison 
to how such group members would fare based on their individual positions or 
characteristics (Stewart, 2002). As a result, the potential of individuals within these 
groups to be productive and to participate in all aspects of society is diminished, as 
is their ability to contribute to, and benefi t from, development.

Inequalities across social or population groups – those that are socially 
embedded and defi ned in terms of social characteristics such as ethnic 
background, culture, language, and so on – also tend to be more persistent over 
time than economic inequalities between individuals (Stewart, 2009). Group 
inequalities span many dimensions, particularly economic, social, political 
and cultural, the interactions among which are likely to explain the persistent 
disadvantages experienced by the members of certain groups. Similar to the 
case with individuals, the lower levels of human capital usually found among 
members of disadvantaged groups (social inequality) may lead to lower incomes 
(economic inequality). Both types of inequality may result in, but at the same 
time may be caused by, the lack of political power. However, faced with persistent 



76 Inequality matters

group inequalities, individuals and families are unlikely to escape poverty because 
it is diffi cult to move across groups, such that a higher proportion of families 
in disadvantaged groups remain deprived over time (Stewart and Langer, 2007). 
Thus, addressing inequalities faced by disadvantaged and marginalized social 
groups is not only an imperative, but also a practical entry point to combating 
inequality in society. 

In addition, many individuals belong to more than one disadvantaged group, 
and inequalities across dimensions often reinforce each another. For example, 
older, young or indigenous women experience setbacks and marginalization 
on the basis of their gender, ethnicity and culture, as well as their age. In 
Bolivia, the probability of a Spanish-speaking woman completing secondary 
education is 5 percentage points lower compared to a Spanish-speaking man. 
The probability declines by 14 percentage points for a man belonging to the 
Quechua people, and by 28 percentage points for a Quechua woman (World 
Bank, 2013). In India, men from Scheduled Tribes are about four times less 
likely to have completed secondary education than men who do not belong to 
Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes, while women from Scheduled Tribes are 
six times less likely than other women to have done so.1

This chapter brings into focus some of the disparities that exist across fi ve 
social and population groups–youth, indigenous peoples, older persons, persons 
with disabilities and migrants–-and also illustrates how such disparities intersect 
with—and reinforce—one another. Indigenous and ethnic groups generally 
share a cultural identity—a common history, language and traditions—while 
young people, older persons and persons with disabilities share a set of 
common distinctions and concerns related to their age or abilities. Similarly, 
migrants have a shared, defi ning experience. Yet, each of these groups faces 
particular disadvantages and barriers, which preclude the full participation 
of the individuals within them in social, economic and political life. Lack of 
participation, at its turn, reinforces the disadvantages they face and limits the 
opportunities they have to infl uence their circumstances. The discussion to 
follow will highlight shared inequalities in poverty, education, employment and 
health outcomes between these social and population groups with respect to the 
rest of the population.

participation in economic, social and political life that, in turn, risk leading to 
long-term inequalities. In many societies, youth are increasingly—and, in some 
cases, alarmingly—disadvantaged in terms of relative income, unemployment, 
working poverty, and other decent work defi cits that point to uncertain futures. 
Many of these problems have been exacerbated by the fi nancial and economic 
crisis and subsequent austerity measures, so much so that today’s youth are seen 
as an entire generation at risk (ILO, 2013a). 

The situation of youth employment poses a host of cumulative long-
term challenges ranging from income insecurity to disruptions in family life. 
Additionally, young people are susceptible to particular health risks and harmful 
behaviour. Yet, frequently, they lack access to knowledge about issues related to 
reproductive health, sexuality and mental health.

A. Youth and inequalities in the labour market

One major concern facing many countries is the question of how to integrate 
youth into the formal labour market and promote equal employment opportunities 
and outcomes among young people. Even in prosperous times, young people 
have experienced challenges in accessing and retaining employment, as labour 
markets have struggled to absorb large populations of youth. In developed 
countries, secure and regular employment with its associated benefi ts—such 
as pensions and social security, which were taken for granted by most of the 
previous generation—are simply no longer available to new entrants into the 
labour force, who are forced increasingly to take on temporary or part-time jobs, 
often at skill levels below their own qualifi cations. In developing countries, 
where nearly 90 per cent of the global youth population resides, informal work 
with low remuneration is increasingly the order of the day, with the exception 
of a few countries where formal employment has increased through proactive 
public policy. 

Unemployment is a particularly severe problem for youth. Although there is 
wide variation, rates of unemployment are signifi cantly higher – generally more 
than double, and often nearly triple – for youth than for adults, in all geographical 
regions. Youth tend to be ‘last in’ and ‘fi rst out’ – the last to be hired, and the fi rst 
to be let go. Due to their age, they have less experience, smaller networks, and 
less information and expertise regarding job searching than prime-aged (aged 
25-54) and older workers, such that many youth are disadvantaged in fi nding 
new employment once they have been dismissed. The most recent rate of global 
youth unemployment stood at 12.3 per cent in 2011. That rate is expected to 
rise to 12.6 per cent in 2013, amounting to more than 73 million young people 
unemployed (see table IV.1).   

Unemployment, particularly prolonged unemployment, during youth can 
have severe, long-term repercussions on equality. In addition to the immediate 
effects of lost earnings, skill development and experience, young people who 
experience unemployment will not recover those losses fully over time; many 



78 Inequality matters

will have lower lifetime earnings and fewer skills than had they not encountered 
unemployment, and will confront unemployment again later in life (Morsy, 
2012). Young people’s diffi culty, in transitioning from school or training into the 
labour force, and in earning decent wages also hinders their ability to contribute 
to family income, become independent, establish their own household and plan 
for child-rearing. Delayed household formation also has broader implications for 
aggregate demand, in particular for housing and consumer durables associated 
with home-ownership. It is estimated that the growth in youth unemployment 
during the economic crisis raised the Gini coeffi cient considerably in some 
developed countries, particularly where young workers were most affected by 
decent work defi cits (Morsy, 2012).

Although rates of youth unemployment in developed countries are expected 
to fall in the coming years, much of the decline is likely to be due to discouraged 
youth dropping out of the labour market (ILO, 2012c). Already, approximately 
6.4 million youth worldwide have grown discouraged and given up on job 
searching, or extended their education in the hope of riding out the jobs crisis 
(ILO, 2012b). In OECD countries, one out of every six young persons is neither 
employed, looking for employment, nor in education or training (ILO, 2013a). 
Though some youth are not in employment, education or training by choice—or 
rather, lack of opportunity—many unemployed or idle youth are not developing 
human capital and are at greater risk of poverty and social exclusion. It is, 
therefore, not surprising that youth poverty has increased signifi cantly in 19

OECD countries since the crisis. In Estonia, Spain and Turkey, in particular, an 
additional 5 per cent of young people fell into poverty between 2007 and 2010. 
Youth poverty decreased only in Germany, where household income grew in 
this period and youth unemployment did not rise (OECD, 2013).

A recent report by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living 
and Working Conditions (Eurofound) found that the economic impact of the 
exclusion of youth, not in employment, education or training (NEET) was at least 
153 billion euros–or 1.2 per cent of European gross domestic product – in 2011. 
Such costs relate mainly to public fi nance as well as to loss of earnings over the 
long term. Youth with low education levels were three times more likely to become 
NEET than those with a tertiary education. Youth with an immigrant background 
as well as those living with disabilities were also signifi cantly more likely than the 
rest of the population to be unemployed or idle (Eurofound, 2012).

Good academic performance and the ease of students’ transition into decent 
work are dependent in large part on the quality and affordability of educational 
systems and programmes and their relevance to the changing needs of the labour 
market. Many young people believe that youth are not being prepared adequately 
for future employment (Mourshed, Farrell and Barton, 2012; United Nations, 
2011a). The skills mismatch in youth labour markets is a persistent problem, as 
is, increasingly, skills obsolescence brought about by long-term unemployment 
(ILO, 2013a). Young women, in particular, are often over-educated for the 
kinds of jobs that are available to them. In many countries, growing levels of 
educational attainment among young people coexist with high levels of youth 
unemployment. The social exclusion, the frustration, the unfi lled expectations 
and even, the hopelessness, of unemployed and underemployed, educated youth 
have been linked to recent social unrest in many countries and regions and most 
prominently, to the protests in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe (ILO, 
2012b; World Bank, 2012b; Stiglitz, 2012).

The general lack of effective education-to-employment systems has often 
led young people to turn to vulnerable jobs and insecure working arrangements, 
such as contractual, temporary or part-time work, hazardous work, low-
productivity jobs, jobs unrelated to their skills, or informal-sector work. Such 
jobs are, typically, associated with poor pay, poor working conditions, and 
limited opportunities for skills-development and -advancement. In the Arab 
Republic of Egypt, youth are twice as likely to work in the informal sector, as 
are adults between the ages of 35 and 54 (World Bank, 2012b). Similarly, in 
the European Union, 17 per cent of young workers are in the informal sector 
compared to 7 per cent of prime-aged workers (aged 25-54) (ILO, 2012c). Part-
time employment in the European Union rose faster among youth than adults 
before, as well as during, the economic crisis. Between the second half of 
2008 and 2011, Ireland saw an increase of 20.7 percentage points in part-time 
employment of youth and Spain an increase of 11.8 percentage points (ILO, 
2012b). Such jobs can help youth to integrate into the labour market initially and 
provide short-term benefi ts, but can also lead to persistent job insecurity. 



80 Inequality matters

In developing countries, where many, including youth, cannot afford to be 
out of work, the majority of workers are in vulnerable employment, comprising 
own-account and unpaid family work. Youth, in particular, are often engaged in 
unpaid work for family businesses or farms. Those who do have paying jobs are 
more likely than prime-aged workers to be in low-wage jobs. Young people also 
confront greater challenges in entrepreneurial activities, as they are less likely 
to qualify for credit and possess fewer skills and less experience (ILO, 2012b). 
These challenges result in disproportionate levels of poverty in working youth 
in developing economies across regions. In countries where data are available, 
youth represent 23.5 per cent of the total working poor, against 18.6 per cent 
of non-poor workers3 (ILO, 2012b). Agricultural-sector work and low levels of 
education are highly correlated with youth working poverty. In Africa, data from 
24 countries suggest that 49 per cent of young workers live on less than $1.25 
per day, and 73 per cent live on less than $2 per day. Similarly, another study 
of 22 African countries showed that 41 per cent of working youth were food 
insecure, or had not had suffi cient food on several occasions over the past year 
(AfDB and others, 2012).

B.  Health risks borne by youth

During the period of adolescence and youth, individuals become susceptible 
to particular health risks and harmful behaviour, such as early pregnancy, 
sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, and inter-personal violence. Other 
potentially risky practices, such as smoking, are also likely to be developed 
during these years. Yet, youth-friendly services, such as access to relevant 
information on health and well-being, and adequate health care and social 
support, are insuffi cient. For example, just 36 per cent of young men and 24 
per cent of young women have suffi cient knowledge to protect themselves from 
contracting HIV (WHO, 2012a). 

Worldwide, 40 per cent of all new adult HIV infections are among youth. 
Among the fi ve million youth living with HIV and AIDS, girls and young women 
are more affected than males (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 
2012). Sexual violence also affects a signifi cant proportion of youth, which is 
particularly worrisome in the context of HIV and AIDS. A multi-country study 
showed that the younger the woman when she had sexual intercourse for the 
fi rst time, the greater the likelihood that her sexual initiation was forced (WHO, 
2005). In two thirds of the settings surveyed, the proportion of women who 
described their fi rst sexual encounter as coerced was over 30 per cent if that 
encounter was reported to have occurred before the age of 15 years, and less 
than 20 per cent among women who had had their fi rst sexual encounter at ages 
15 to 18 years. 

Teenage pregnancy is detrimental to the health of both mother and child. It

also correlates with lower educational attainment and poverty. Complications 
from pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death among women aged 
15 to 19 years in developing countries. Yet, at the global level, more than 10 per 
cent of all births occur among women aged 15 to 19 years, mainly in developing 
countries (WHO, 2012a). Inter-personal violence is also a signifi cant cause of 
youth mortality and disability, particularly among males. An estimated 250,000 
homicides occur annually among youth aged 10 to 29 years, representing 41 per 
cent of the global annual number of homicides (WHO, 2011).

II.  Inequalities faced by older persons4

Although many older persons around the world are able to participate in all 
aspects of society and to maintain adequate living standards through retirement 
pensions, ongoing work or familial support, many others, in both developed 
and developing countries, confront increasing levels of poverty, poor health and 
social exclusion. Older persons are disproportionately at risk of inadequate and 
insecure income, insuffi cient access to quality health care and other services—
such as fi nance and accessible transportation and housing—and pervasive 
discrimination on the basis of their age.

A.  Older persons and poverty 

The incidence of poverty among older persons varies signifi cantly among 
countries and data are not always available. However, in general, in developing 
countries without well-developed social security systems, older persons are 
generally less well-off than the rest of the population. Their living standards 
are also lower, in part because they are more likely to live in rural areas, where 
poverty is more prevalent.5 Figure IV.1 illustrates the percentage of older 
persons in several developing and emerging economies that are in the bottom 
wealth quintile, as estimated using DHS surveys. In some countries, households 
headed by older persons will have more of certain assets than those headed by 
younger persons, due to accumulation over the life cycle. However, even such 
older households may lack a regular or secure income, or liquid assets. In 30 out 
of the 44 countries shown, older persons are poorer than average, based on this 
indicator. 

In many countries of the OECD, however, in the last two decades, older 
persons have seen greater income gains than other social groups. Still, in 2010, 
the percentage of older persons living in poverty (defi ned as having an income 
below half of the national median income), was above that of the total population 

4  The United Nations defi nes older persons as men and women aged 60 years or over. 
In many developed countries, the cutoff point of 65 years is used to refer to older persons.  
5  The DHS wealth index is calculated with data on household ownership of assets such 
as televisions and types of access to drinking water.

in only 11 out of 26 countries with data (see Table IV.2). Older women tend 
to experience higher rates of poverty than older men, in some countries even 
reaching more than triple men’s levels. In addition to gender, household structure 
is a key determinant of old-age poverty. Among households headed by an older 
person, single individuals experienced income poverty at a rate of 25 per cent, 
compared to 9.5 per cent for couples, on average (OECD, 2011).

The extent and degree of poverty and inequality experienced by older 
persons are generally linked to the presence (or absence) of social protection 
schemes and the level of benefi ts they provide (United Nations, 2007; OECD, 
2011; Barrientos, 2006). Older persons experience distinct vulnerabilities in 
income security, yet longer life expectancies and changing family structures—
whereby older persons are being cared for by family members less frequently—
underscore the fact that the issue is of critical importance. Although, on average, 
legislated contributory pension programmes cover 40 per cent of the global 
working-age population, there is signifi cant variation across regions. Effective 
coverage is lower than legal coverage in all regions, pointing mainly to gaps in 
programme implementation, or funding (ILO, 2010). Accordingly, less than one 
out of every fi ve older persons worldwide has public pension coverage (United 
Nations, 2011a).

In high-income countries, approximately 75 per cent of persons aged 65 years 
and over benefi t from some form of pension, compared to an average of less than

84 Inequality matters

20 per cent of older persons in low-income countries. Standard pension systems 
cover mainly workers in the formal sector, whereas most of the working-age 
population in low-income countries are employed in the informal sector. Where 
contributory social security systems exist, older women are disadvantaged vis-
à-vis older men in terms of pension levels and other benefi ts (United Nations 
Offi ce of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 2012). In most countries, 
women are less likely than men to work in the formal sector, where pension 
coverage is higher. Additionally, women earn, on average, lower wages and 
frequently spend less time in the labour force, due mainly to child-rearing and 
care-giving activities. In some cases, women are disadvantaged further by limited 
pension entitlements, such as where they may be covered by a husband’s or former 
spouse’s pension, or following the death of a husband – despite women’s greater 
life expectancy and lower levels of remarriage (ILO, 2010). When older women 
receive pension income, it is often used for family expenses, such as school fees 
and meals (UNFPA and HelpAge International, 2012).  

Across all regions, voluntary coverage for self-employed persons extends 
to just 4 per cent of the working-age population (ILO, 2010). Some developing 
countries have been establishing, and expanding, social protection programmes, 
including non-contributory or social pensions, which ensure a minimum level 
of income to all persons or to those not covered by a contributory system. Such 
systems can be highly effective in reducing poverty and inequality, especially 
among older persons belonging to marginalized and disadvantaged social groups. 

B.  Employment and health inequalities faced by older persons

Universal pensions are important, not only as a matter of social justice, but because 
older persons face a range of challenges in employment. In many countries, older 
persons have lower social status and confront widespread, age-based discrimination 
in hiring, training and retention, as well as high rates of long-term unemployment 
(defi ned as unemployment for 12 months or more), which can be found even where 
their overall levels of unemployment are relatively low (UNFPA and HelpAge 
International, 2012). In Europe, seven out of ten respondents to a survey believed 
that the greatest barriers to participation in the labour force by persons aged 55 
years or older were: inadequate opportunities to limit working hours gradually, 
exclusion from workplace training, and employers’ negative perceptions of older 
employees. Moreover, the most pervasive form of age discrimination was reported 
to be workplace-related, with 21 per cent of respondents having either experienced, 
or witnessed, age discrimination in the past two years while in the workplace or 
seeking work (European Commission, Eurobarometer, 2012). Older persons’ 
disproportionately high rates of long-term unemployment may be linked to age-based 
discrimination. Once unemployed, older persons are less likely to be rehired and, if 
rehired, are likely to experience greater wage losses (OECD, 2006). Approximately 
44 per cent of older workers in the United States had been unemployed for at least 
one year, in comparison to 21 per cent of the 20- to 24-year-old workers and 12 per 
cent of workers below age 20 (Kurtzleben, 2012).



Identity and inequality: Focus on social groups 85

Older persons also face multiple barriers to accessing health care, precisely 
during the stage in life when health care is often most needed. They often 
confront discriminatory attitudes and receive poor or inadequate treatment, if 
any. In Europe, evidence exists of age limitations and price infl ation in health-
insurance policies for older persons (Murphy, 2012). In surveys from developing 
countries, older persons have reported multiple forms of discrimination in 
seeking health care, from disrespectful treatment to outright refusal of treatment 
(Sleap, 2011). In a multi-country survey of older persons, the majority of 
respondents–63 per cent–found it diffi cult to access health care when needed 
(HelpAge International, 2011). 

User fees and medication costs, lack of data and investment related to the 
situation of older persons, location of services, and lack of age-friendly services 
and structures are some of the other common—and even ubiquitous—factors 
that perpetuate inequalities faced by older persons. A prominent example is 
the experience of older persons with HIV. In addition to serving frequently as 
caregivers to infected younger family members, many older persons themselves 
have the virus. Yet, statistics on HIV and AIDS are often gathered on persons 
only up to age 49 or 59. Similarly, older persons are rarely screened for the 
virus, and programmes on HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment seldom 
target older populations (United Nations, 2011b). Such failure to consider older 
persons in relevant research and initiatives is generally based on the mistaken 
assumption that older persons are unlikely to engage in activities that could 
transmit the virus. Consequently, older persons may be put at greater risk due to 
lack of awareness of safe practices and testing or treatment resources. 

Access to health care plays a key role in the health outcomes of older 
persons, particularly those who might be living with disabilities. More than 46 
per cent of older people aged 60 and over have disabilities. The prevalence of 
disabilities among older persons increases with age and geographic location, 
despite the fact that many of these disabilities are preventable. Older persons in 
developing countries are more likely to have disabilities than those in developed 
countries, and older women in both developing and developed countries are 
more likely than men to have disabilities. For example, visual impairments are 
three times more prevalent among older persons in developing countries than in 
developed countries (UNFPA and HelpAge International, 2012).

III.  Inequalities faced by persons with disabilities

Persons with disabilities are at a disadvantage compared to the general 
population across several dimensions of social and economic well-being (WHO 
and World Bank, 2011). This disadvantage is very often the result of a disabling 
environment: physical and institutional barriers, discrimination and exclusion. 
Often, persons with disabilities are rendered invisible, or considered to be 
incapable of participating in society, or even in processes of decision-making 



86 Inequality matters

regarding policies that affect them. Yet, such exclusion has costs. For instance, 
excluding persons with disabilities from the world of work costs societies 
not only the value of their lost potential productivity but also the expense of 
providing disability benefi ts and pen sions. One study of ten countries in Asia 
and Africa estimated that this exclusion might cost coun tries between 1 and 7 
per cent of GDP (Buckup, 2009).

A. Persons with disabilities and poverty

Disability is more common among women, older people and households that 
are poor, and lower-income countries have a higher prevalence of disability 
than higher-income countries (WHO and World Bank, 2011). Although few 
studies have looked at the prevalence of disability among poor households, one 
such study of 15 developing countries showed that the economic situation of 
households that had at least one member with a disability was worse than the 
situation of households without any person with a disability. In 10 out of those 
15 countries, households that had at least one member with a disability had 
signifi cantly lower assets (Mitra, Posarac and Vick, 2011). At the individual 
level, disability has a two-way relationship with poverty, which creates a vicious 
circle: disability may increase the risk of poverty, for example, by excluding 
individuals from education and work, but poverty may also increase the risk of 
disability, inter alia, through malnutrition or poor living and working conditions 
(The Lancet, 2009; WHO and World Bank, 2011). It is estimated that 20 per 
cent of the world’s poorest persons have disabilities (Elwan, 1999). At the same 
time, persons with disabilities are more likely to live in poverty than persons 
without disabilities. Data from 59 countries surveyed in the WHO World Health 
Survey (2002-2004), showed that, in lower-income countries, 22.4 per cent of 
all persons with disabilities were in the poorest wealth quintile compared to 
13.3 per cent in the richest quintile (WHO and World Bank, 2011). In a separate 
study of 18 out of 21 OECD countries with data, working-age people with 
disabilities showed higher poverty rates (defi ned as less than 60 per cent of the 
median-adjusted disposable income) than those without disabilities. On average, 
across OECD countries, the income of persons with disabilities was 12 per cent 
lower than the national average and as much as 20 to 30 per cent lower in some 
countries (OECD, 2009). 

B.  Persons with disabilities face educational, employment and health 
              inequalities

Most of the evidence suggests that children with disabilities tend to have lower 
school attendance rates compared to children without disabilities. Data from 
surveys conducted in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe show that 
children with disabilities aged from 6 years to 17 years are less likely to start 
school, or to be enrolled (Mitra, Posarac and Vick, 2011). Similarly, in South 
Africa, being physically disabled or having some other type of disability has 



Identity and inequality: Focus on social groups 87

been positively associated with the likelihood of dropping out of primary and 
secondary school (Sibanda, 2004). Similarly, a recent study by WHO based 
on data for 51 developed and developing countries found that primary school 
completion rates for boys with disabilities were only 51 per cent, compared to 61 
per cent for boys without disabilities. The intersecting deprivation determined 
by gender is evident here as well: the corresponding rates for girls were only 42 
per cent for girls with disabilities and 53 per cent for girls without disabilities  
(UNICEF, 2013). 

There is also consistent evidence that adults with disabilities have lower 
educational attainment than their peers without disabilities. In a study of 15 
countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, in 
12 of the 15 countries the mean number of years of education completed was 
signifi cantly lower among persons with disabilities. In 14 of these countries, the 
percentage of individuals who completed primary education was signifi cantly 
lower among persons with disabilities (Mitra, Posarac and Vick, 2011). 

Regular school systems rarely provide learning opportunities to all 
students, especially those with disabilities. In many countries, public resources 
for children with disabilities are directed to segregated schools instead of to 
mainstream education in one, inclusive system. Yet segregated schools may not 
be suitable, or even cost-effi cient, for students with disabilities. In one country, 
special schooling cost up to three times more than schooling for children without 
disabilities (UNICEF, 2013). Resources would be more effi ciently used if they 
were directed towards enabling children—both with and without disabilities—
to attend the same age-appropriate classes, with appropriate infrastructure and 
individually-tailored support, as required.

Persons with disabilities also tend to have lower employment rates than 
persons without disabilities. The World Report on Disability 2011 found that, 
among 51 countries, women with disabilities were 10.3 per cent less likely than 
women without disabilities to be employed, and that men with disabilities were 
12.1 per cent less likely than men without disabilities to be employed (WHO and 
World Bank, 2011). As shown in fi gure IV.2, the disability gaps in employment 
rates were largest in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, smallest in the countries 
of Latin America, and ranged in between in the countries of Asia. Persons with 
multiple disabilities suffered the most from the disability gap in employment 
rates (Mizunoya and Mitra, 2013).

Employment inequalities experienced by people with disabilities are found 
in both developing and developed countries. In most developed countries, 
persons with disabilities of working age have an unemployment rate that is at 
least twice that of persons without disabilities (United Nations 2012a). A study 
of 27 OECD countries found that 44 per cent of working-age persons with 
disabilities were in employment and 49 per cent were inactive, while 75 per cent 
of working-age persons without disabilities were in employment and just 20 per 
cent were inactive (OECD, 2010b).



88 Inequality matters

Not only are people with disabilities less likely to fi nd work than people 
without disabilities but, worse yet, they have little chance of fi nding decent 
work. When persons with disabilities are employed, they are more likely to be 
underemployed, receive lower earnings and experience higher job insecurity, 
even in high-income countries (OECD, 2009). In developing countries, many 
persons with disabilities work in the informal sector, where there is very little 
job protection and stability (Murray, 2012). Women with disabilities are even 
less likely to be employed than men with disabilities, and also earn less when 
they are employed. 

Disability gaps in health exist as well. At the household level, there are 
inequalities in health expenses. On average, households with persons with 
disabilities report spending a signifi cantly higher proportion of their expenditure 
on health care (Mitra, Posarac and Vick, 2011). At the individual level, there 
are signifi cant inequalities between persons with disabilities and the general 
population in health outcomes and access to health care. Some of these health 
inequalities result from the fact that certain health conditions that cause disability 
are associated with the increased risk of specifi c co-morbidity (Mayeux, 2007; 
Prince and others, 2007; WHO and World Bank, 2011).  Very often, though, 
these health inequalities are the results of barriers faced by persons with 
disabilities in accessing effective health-care services, barriers that are not just

physical, environmental, economic and societal in nature, but also the result of 
neglect, abuse and acts of discrimination committed by caregivers or health-care 
professionals themselves (Hughes and others, 2012; Jones and others, 2012; 
WHO, 2012b; WHO and World Bank, 2011). 

IV.   Inequalities faced by indigenous peoples 

In countries and regions (Latin America, Northern America and Oceania) where 
data disaggregated by indigenous status exist, it is well documented that indigenous 
peoples face many socioeconomic disadvantages relative to non-indigenous 
peoples (Hall and Patrinos, 2012). Studies indicate that half of the gap in earnings 
between indigenous and non-indigenous groups is due to human capital defi cits. 
Lower educational levels, lack of skills or abilities, lower employment rates and 
poorer health all contribute to higher poverty rates for indigenous groups. The 
other half of the gap is due to unknown factors, which may represent the impact 
of discrimination and other social forces, in the labour market (World Bank and 
IMF, 2011). 

A.  Indigenous peoples and poverty, educational, employment and
               health inequalities 

Around the world, indigenous peoples are among the poorest groups, accounting 
for 10 per cent of the world’s poor. Moreover, one third of indigenous people 
worldwide are poor (United Nations, 2009; World Bank and IMF, 2011). In the 
United States, for example, an indigenous person living on a reservation is four 
times more likely to live in poverty than an average citizen, and more than one 
quarter of the indigenous population live below the offi cial poverty line (Hall 
and Patrinos, 2012). In countries of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin America, 
poverty rates were between 1.5 and 5.1 times higher among indigenous peoples 
than in the rest of the population in the mid-2000s (table IV.3). With a few notable 
exceptions (Chile and Mexico), poverty rates have not improved much among 
indigenous peoples in Latin American countries, especially in countries with 
large indigenous populations such as Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Peru. 
By contrast, poverty rates have declined rapidly in Asian countries that have 
experienced rapid economic growth recently (such as China and Viet Nam), and 
the decline has very often occurred more rapidly among the indigenous than the 
non-indigenous population (World Bank and IMF, 2011).

Although indigenous traditional knowledge and livelihoods are rarely taken 
into account, in many countries, indigenous peoples have lower educational 
outcomes and experience lower employment rates than non-indigenous peoples. 
Among indigenous peoples, illiteracy levels are higher, school enrolment ratios 
are lower, school performances are poorer and average years of schooling are 
far fewer (López, 2009; Macdonald, 2012; World Bank and IMF, 2011; United 
Nations, 2009; UNESCO, 2010; Hall and Patrinos, 2012). In sub-Saharan Africa, 



90 Inequality matters

the literacy rate of some indigenous groups can be as much as four to fi ve times 
lower than the national rate, as was the case among the Pygmies in the Congo 
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as the Peuhls in Benin in 
the mid-2000s. In the Central African Republic, gross primary enrolment ratios 
are only 7 per cent for the Mbororos and 21 per cent for the Pygmies, but reach 
73 per cent for non-indigenous groups. The differences persist at the secondary 
level. In Gabon, the gross primary enrolment ratio is only 4 per cent for Pygmies 
compared to 80 per cent for non-Pygmies.  

As regards employment inequalities, there is ample evidence that indigenous 
peoples are excluded from the labour force, which reinforces the persistence of 
their poverty levels (United Nations, 2009; Statistics Canada, 2011). In Australia, 
the 2006 indigenous unemployment rate of 15.6 per cent was more than three 
times higher than the rate among the non-indigenous population. Similarly, in 
New Zealand, the Maori unemployment rate of 7.7 per cent was more than twice 
the national average of 3.8 per cent (United Nations, 2009).

There are also signifi cant disparities in health status between indigenous 
and non-indigenous peoples. Indigenous groups experience disadvantages in 
terms of both morbidity (prevalence of communicable and non-communicable 
diseases, malnutrition, suicide and violence) and mortality (United Nations, 
2009). For instance, child malnutrition prevalence tends to be worse among 
indigenous groups than in the rest of the population in countries of sub-Saharan 
Africa, Asia and Latin America. By the mid-2000s, the prevalence of stunting 
among indigenous children was three to four times higher in Cameroon (53.6 
per cent among the Pygmies versus 13 per cent nationally), Gabon (51 per 
cent among the Pygmies versus 6.7 per cent nationally), Namibia (25.6 per 
cent among the Sans versus 7.3 per cent nationally), and Mexico (44.3 per 
cent among the indigenous population versus 14.5 per cent among the non-
indigenous population) (Macdonald, 2012). 

Indigenous groups tend to experience higher mortality levels than the rest of 
the population in both developing and developed countries. By the mid-2000s, 
mortality rates in children under age fi ve were higher than national rates among 
almost all the indigenous groups analysed by Macdonald (2012). Gaps in life 
expectancy are also apparent in both developing and developed countries, and 
differences in life expectancy between indigenous and non-indigenous groups 
are as great as 20 years in Australia and Nepal (United Nations, 2009). In Latin 
America, maternal mortality levels are also higher for indigenous peoples, 
particularly in remote areas. In Ecuador, for instance, the maternal mortality 
rate of 250 maternal deaths per 100,000 women measured among indigenous 
peoples living in remote areas was over three times higher than the national rate 
of 74.3 per 100,000 measured in 2003 (Montenegro and Stephens, 2006).

While indigenous peoples worldwide continue to be among the poorest 
groups, and tend to suffer from lower educational and poorer health status 
and greater incidence of discrimination than other groups, no clear differences

exist in some countries (especially the poorest) between indigenous and non-
indigenous groups in terms of such development indicators. Moreover, within 
some countries, the experiences of different indigenous groups vary, with some 
indigenous groups showing better development indicators than others. Such 
variation is evident among the various Mayan peoples in Guatemala and Native 
American groups in the United States. Sometimes, the performance of some 
indigenous peoples even exceeds that of the population as a whole. For instance, 
several Scheduled Tribes in the Northeastern States of India fare better than 
the population as a whole, in terms of under-fi ve mortality and child stunting 
prevalence. Similarly, the Aymara of Peru and the Guarani of Bolivia exhibit 
better levels of under-fi ve mortality, water deprivation, child stunting and 
literacy than the national population (Macdonald, 2012).

B.  Indigenous peoples, inequalities in land rights and environmental 
              challenges 

A great number of indigenous peoples live in precarious conditions and 
are marginalized, often as a result of forced displacement and the impacts of 
globalization and climate change, leading to serious inequalities and poverty 
(United Nations, 2009). Indigenous peoples retain deep ties to their ancestral 
lands and territories and the resources these contain. Land, and resources such as 
water, timber and wildlife, have provided for the subsistence and development 
of indigenous groups, which have used their traditional knowledge and expertise 
to manage their territories’ resources effi ciently and sustainably. Yet indigenous 
peoples face environmental challenges on multiple fronts that increase their 
social marginalization and disadvantage. 

Dispossession of indigenous people’s traditional lands and territories– 
which are often sources of valuable natural resources, such as oil and minerals 
–by both public and private entities has generated tensions over land tenure and 
access to productive land in many countries, adversely affecting the economic 
and socio-cultural stability of indigenous peoples. Many members of Scheduled 
Tribes in India have, for example, been forced to migrate to cities or nearby 
areas (8.5 million people between 1951 and 1990) and work as construction 
workers or agricultural labourers, as they have lost access to their traditional 
lands (Das and others, 2012).

Indigenous peoples have found that many development policies and 
projects fail to consult them, encroach on their land rights and—either directly 
or indirectly—harm their traditional production methods. Large-scale and 
resource-intensive development projects can not only result in eviction and 
loss of traditional territories and land, but also generate challenges related to 
migration and resettlement, depletion of resources necessary for physical and 
cultural survival, pollution and destruction of the traditional environment, social 
and community disorganization and, in some cases, harassment and violence. 
Critical to the prosperity—and even survival—of indigenous culture is the ability 



Identity and inequality: Focus on social groups 93

of indigenous peoples to own and manage their lands, territories and resources 
according to their collective rights. Responding to appeals from indigenous 
peoples, and in line with recent international instruments, several countries, 
particularly in Latin America, have enacted legal reforms to recognize the 
rights of indigenous peoples over the protection and control of their territories, 
lands and resources. However, implementation of reforms such as land titling is 
widely lagging and uneven. 

Indigenous peoples are also particularly at risk from the impacts of climate 
change, due to their dependence on the environment and its resources. Thus, 
the thawing permafrost in the Arctic region, the rising sea levels in the Pacifi c 
Islands region, and the frequent droughts in the semi-arid lands of sub-Saharan 
Africa are destroying traditional food sources and habitats (vegetation, livestock 
and fi sh stocks), and forcing indigenous people in these regions to relocate to 
other territories, making them environmental refugees.

V.  Inequalities faced by migrants

Migration is a forceful symbol of inequality, whether in terms of income, labour 
market opportunities, access to social services, security or lifestyle. Millions 
of people move each year, within their countries or across borders, seeking to 
improve their situation and reduce the gap they perceive between their position 
and that of people in other, often wealthier, places. Many of these migrants may 
end up better off than they would have been if they had not moved. Nevertheless, 
migration also carries signifi cant risks and costs and its outcomes are dependent 
on a number of contextual factors. Poor access by immigrants to good education 
and health care, lack of political voice, work in the informal sector, immigration 
policies as well as deep-rooted social, racial, ethnic and gender barriers often 
limit both the opportunities available to them and the outcomes of their move. 
While many immigrants do gain from moving, they are often disadvantaged in 
comparison to individuals born in the regions or countries of destination. 

A. Inequalities and trade-off s: migrants and those who stay behind

Migration constitutes an important income-diversifi cation strategy and can play 
an important role in reducing poverty and improving the livelihoods of those who 
move. On average, migrants are economically better off than those who do not 
migrate. For instance, the income of foreign-born persons in OECD countries is 
higher than income per capita in their countries of origin, with the differences 
being particularly large among those coming from the least developed countries6 
(Clemens and Prichett, 2008).  A comparison of workers with similar characteristics 
(e.g. same country of birth, country of education, years of education, work 
experience) in and outside of the United States indicates that foreign-born workers 

6  GDP per capita at PPP (constant 2000 $).



94 Inequality matters

in the United States earn four times as much as they would have in their countries 
of origin (Clemens, Montenegro and Prichett, 2008). Individuals and families who 
move from one developing country to another, and even internal migrants, also 
tend to access better opportunities, earn higher salaries and are able to diversify 
their sources of livelihood (UNDP, 2009). An analysis of Demographic and Health 
Survey (DHS) data shows that internal migrants work more often in skilled, non-
manual positions than non-migrants in a majority of developing countries with 
data.7 The migrant/non-migrant gap is highly signifi cant in most of these countries, 
even after adjusting for differences in age, childhood residence (urban-rural) and 
current residence (United Nations, 2008). 

A better-paid job is not the only reason for migrating. Individuals and 
families also move in order to give their children a better education, get 
access to better health care and other services, or become more independent 
and empowered. Migration can also be triggered by displacement or loss of 
livelihood in the place of origin. Oftentimes, it enhances educational attainment 
and has a positive impact on children’s health; enrolment rates are higher and 
child mortality is lower among children of immigrants in OECD countries than 
in countries of origin, on average, and also among internal migrants in the 
majority of developing countries (Ortega, 2009; Harttgen and Klasen, 2009). 
Nevertheless, improvements in education or health are not as large as those in 
income. Even when immigrants gain economically, poor access to services may 
hinder their human development and inhibit well-being. 

Migration has costs and carries risk. Financially, travel expenses, offi cial 
fees and documents and settlement costs typify a journey that can, at times, 
last for years (UNDP, 2009; De Haas, 2006; Papadopoulou, 2008). In addition, 
migration often involves separation from family members. While individual 
migrants and their families often benefi t economically from the move, children 
and other family members can be affected adversely in various ways (Cortes, 
2008; Rossi, 2008). 

Overall, the risks that migration entails, as well as its outcomes, are 
distributed unevenly and affected greatly by the conditions under which people 
move. Those who are forced to move by confl ict, insecurity or desperation, 
or who move using irregular channels, have less choice than those who move 
freely or through regular channels in search of better opportunities. In general, 
moving involves trade-offs: people who migrate gain in some dimensions of 
well-being and lose in others. Moving may affect material well-being positively, 
yet migrants often face hostility and discrimination and lose civic and electoral 
rights. Moving can empower women and youth by allowing them to participate 
in the labour market and gain autonomy, even though it involves separation 

7  Internal migrant women, defi ned as those who moved during the six years preceding 
the interview, were more likely to work in skilled, non-manual occupations in 29 out of 42 
developing countries with data available in the early to mid-2000s, while internal migrant 
men were likelier to work in more skilled jobs in 24 out of 27 countries with data.

from family and friends. Yet, in many cases, social and policy barriers curtail the 
gains from migration, including economic gains.

B.  Disparities between migrants and natives of the regions or   
               countries of destination

Disadvantages experienced by immigrants, in the area or country of destination, 
are often refl ected in enduring disparities between them and those born in 
receiving areas (natives). Information from developed countries shows that 
international migrants experience higher unemployment rates and, when they 
are employed, work more often in precarious and informal jobs and have lower 
income than natives, even at comparable levels of education. Education does 
not grant equal treatment to immigrants in the economy and the labour market. 
In the European Union, the share of foreign-born workers with higher education 
working in low- and middle-skilled jobs (36 per cent), is almost double that 
of natives (19 per cent) (European Commission, 2011). Over-qualifi cation 
relative to actual employment is observed even among immigrants who have 
been in the European Union for 10 years or longer. Similarly, in the United 
States, the proportion of international immigrants with higher education is larger 
than that of natives, yet immigrants earn lower salaries and work less often in 
managerial and other highly skilled positions.8 In Canada, over-qualifi cation or 
brain waste has been estimated to drain $1.7 billion a year from the economy 
(Reitz, 2005). One problem is that the skills and credentials earned abroad often 
go unrecognized. Poor host-country language skills, a provisional or irregular 
legal status, and discrimination are other factors that infl uence the inequalities 
observed. Discrimination and other social barriers are deeply entrenched 
through social and cultural norms and affect internal migrants as well. In many 
developing countries, for instance, uneducated migrants from rural to urban 
areas often fare worse in the labour market than other urban residents, and are 
treated as outsiders (UNDP, 2009). 

As a result of these disadvantages, immigrants are at a higher risk of poverty 
and exclusion than natives. In addition, many immigrants have limited or no 
access to social protection, partly because they work more often in informal jobs 
and under non-standard contracts. Many countries restrict access by temporary 
immigrants to unemployment benefi ts, health care and various social transfers, 
even when they work in the formal economy (UNDP, 2009). While 20 per cent of 
European Union natives are at risk of poverty or exclusion, the proportion is 35 
per cent among those born outside the European Union (European Commission, 
2011). In the United States, the percentage of persons below the national poverty 

8  The proportion of families earning $75,000 per year or over was 41.5 per cent for 
those headed by a native-born person and 31.5 per cent for those headed by a foreign-born 
(United States Census Bureau, 2012 Statistical Abstract, Population: Native and Foreign-
Born Population. Available [online] at: http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/
population/native_and_foreign-born_populations.html. Accessed on 14 March 2013).

line was 13.5 among native-born persons and 19.0 among foreign-born persons 
in 2009 (United States Census Bureau, 2012).

Inequalities often affect immigrants who arrived as children and are 
even inherited by those born in the area or country of destination (the second 
generation). Most evidence indicates that children of immigrants do better than 
their parents in terms of education, labour-market situation and income, but 
they do not catch up fully to children with no immigrant background. While 
their educational attainment differs greatly by country, children in the second 
generation are generally at greater risk than other children of dropping out of 
school before completing secondary education, and often perform less well than 
other students (European Commission, 2011; OECD, 2012). Their disadvantage 
is due, in part, to their socioeconomic background. Students from disadvantaged 
backgrounds, including those with an immigrant background, tend to concentrate 
in poor neighbourhoods and under-resourced schools that, for example, suffer 
from low teacher-to-student ratios. However, signifi cant differences remain after 
controlling for parental education, occupation, household living standards and 
other characteristics. For instance, reading outcomes at age 15 are lower among 
the second generation in 21 out of 27 OECD countries with data, even after 
accounting for socioeconomic characteristics (OECD, 2012). Countries with 
educational systems that separate students according to performance at an early 
age, such as Germany, or those in which there is strong residential segregation 
and a high concentration of disadvantaged students, have the biggest gaps in 
school performance. 

In the labour market, second-generation youth suffer from higher levels 
of unemployment than workers with no immigrant background, even at 
similar levels of education (European Commission, 2011). For the employed, 
differences in wage and occupation are small and, for some groups, these tend 
to disappear as workers age, suggesting that the greatest hurdle for children of 
migrants is to get a foothold in the labour market. Limited access to employment-
related networks, and discrimination, particularly against ethnic minorities, are 
some of the structural obstacles found by the second generation in accessing 
employment. Even though many countries have enacted anti-discrimination 
legislation, limited compliance and lack of awareness curtail its effectiveness 
(Lessard-Phillips and others, 2012). Countries where the educational system 
provides extended vocational training options, and those in which labour unions 
and employers are actively engaged in integrating minorities, have done better 
in reducing the risk of unemployment among second-generation youth (Liebig 
and Schröder, 2010; Heath, Rothon and Kilpi, 2008).

VI.  Conclusion

The above sections have described how diverse social groups—which share an 
identity and certain distinct characteristics—experience similar disadvantages, 



Identity and inequality: Focus on social groups 97

in particular in the realms of income, education, employment and health. 
They confront barriers that prevent them from fulfi lling their potential and 
participating fully in society; they face exclusion and are considerably less likely 
to enjoy the fruits of development. They are denied opportunities, often branded 
by stereotype and stigma, and discriminated against. Lack of participation 
perpetuates the disadvantages they experience and their ability to infl uence 
their circumstances. The persistence of such barriers and disadvantages across 
generations leads to broad inequality traps. 

The chapter also highlighted how inequalities experienced by social groups 
do not occur in isolation, but rather, tend to overlap across key domains of 
opportunity. For example, good-quality education accessible to all young people 
– especially those who are indigenous or have disabilities – promotes their health 
literacy and the likelihood that they will engage in healthy behaviour, develops 
the skills needed to attain decent work and wages eventually, and builds their 
long-term awareness of citizenship and the importance of participating in 
society. At the same time, good health enables individuals to perform well in 
school and in jobs or traditional livelihoods, to continue to work into old age, 
and to participate in family and community life. Both successes and gaps in such 
domains are, therefore, interconnected. Yet, it is in this way that manifestations 
of inequalities in each of these areas intersect and, thereby, persist.

In charting the course for the future United Nations development agenda, 
the High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the post-2015 agenda called for 
reaching excluded groups: “Leave no one behind”, it advised; “We should ensure 
that no person–regardless of ethnicity, gender, geography, disability, race or other 
status–is denied universal human rights and basic economic opportunities.” 
Addressing inequalities between social groups is crucial in and of itself, but 
it is also necessary for social cohesion, sustainable economic growth, political 
stability, and development processes in general. 

Enhancing social inclusion is a long-term process, particularly when 
inequalities are rooted in historical and cultural norms but, as Chapter 5 will 
discuss, it can be done, namely, by expanding opportunities, improving abilities 
and according dignity. Although each social group may face particular challenges, 
and the needs of these groups may be prioritized differently, overcoming group-
based inequalities requires a policy approach that goes beyond piecemeal, 
group-specifi c measures. As Chapter 5 will highlight, policies to address the 
negative impacts of inequalities on particular social groups need to emphasize 
the empowerment of all members of society in building human and social 
capital. They must focus on developing inclusive institutions and expanding 
access to basic services, and on ensuring that the services provided address the 
needs of all social and cultural groups in society effectively. Policies must also 
be based on the clear and thorough understanding of the social, political and 
cultural norms at work in creating positions of disadvantage in the fi rst place, to 
ensure that the root causes of discrimination and social, political, cultural and 
economic exclusion are addressed.

Chapter 5

What can be done to tackle 
inequaliti es?

I. Taking stock

The analysis in the previous four chapters shows that there has been an upsurge 
in economic inequality in many countries, both developed and developing, in 
the past thirty years. In the majority of countries, the distribution of assets, 
incomes and wages has become increasingly unequal. However, in the past 
decade, several countries have bucked the trend of rising inequality, suggesting 
that domestic social and economic policies can play a crucial role in determining   
inequality trends. These policies can serve as positive examples of not just what 
can work, but of what has worked already. 

Inequality across countries is still larger than inequality within most 
countries. Opportunities in life still depend largely on an individual’s country of 
residence.  Nonetheless, there is some evidence of convergence across countries 
in terms of per capita incomes. The decline in international inequality is due 
largely to the more rapid growth of a relatively small number of large countries. 
Thus, international cooperation to create an international environment that 
enables poor countries to grow faster is important for reducing aggregate global 
inequality. 

It is clear that high, and rising, inequalities have had adverse economic, 
social and political impacts, with—often—dire consequences for social stability 
and cohesion, political participation and stability, and poverty reduction, as well 
as for the rate and stability of economic growth. 

In addition, economic, social, political and cultural inequalities interact, 
generating persistent disadvantages among members of certain social groups 
and creating inequality traps. This makes the reduction of inequality a diffi cult, 
complex task. Ensuring that improvements in one area are not hindered by 
growing inequality in others is, therefore, important. This calls for an integrated 
policy approach and a specifi c policy focus on disadvantaged groups. 

In this context, the following section considers policies that address 



100 Inequality matters

some aspect of inequality. It purports to be a set of cohesive, coherent and 
complementary policies (social, monetary and fi scal, developmental, trade and 
industrial, and other) to attack inequality in its various dimensions, since stand-
alone policies are unlikely to have much effect.

II.  Addressing inequality 

Rising inequality is not destiny. In fact, certain social and economic policies 
have demonstrated their impact on reducing various dimensions of inequality. 
Experiences show that—while the national context is important for policy 
effectiveness in combating inequality—there are elements that underlie 
successful actions to reduce social and economic inequalities .1  These elements, 
illustrated by examples whenever possible, are the subject of the analysis below. 

A.  Universalism in the provision of social services 

Ensuring public funding for the universal provision of basic amenities – access 
to housing, water, sanitation and electricity, as well as essential social services 
such as nutrition, health and education – is critical to the reduction of poverty 
and the promotion of equality of opportunity. 

Universal provision is more cost-effi cient than targeted delivery because 
of the high levels of administrative capacity required for means-testing, the 
high transaction costs of targeted measures, and the risk of political capture by 
the elites or the richest regions and its potential impact on social segmentation. 
Indeed, it has been argued that systems in which benefi ts are not targeted 
towards low-income groups are precisely the ones that benefi t those groups 
most (Danson and others, 2013). Further, universalism creates broader public 
support and a wider public demand for a better quality of public service which, 
in turn, enables the imposition of a more progressive tax system that helps 
reduce income inequality while increasing social cohesion and stability. This 
underscores the strong arguments being made in the international public policy 
discourse in favour of a move from targeted safety nets back to universal social 
provision (Deacon, 2005).

Despite these advantages, universal social policies have often given way 
to targeted social transfers in recent decades, especially when greater policy 
emphasis is placed on short-term results in the development discourse. Targeting 
of specifi c groups has often been suggested by multilateral fi nancial institutions 
and donors as a way of achieving social objectives without a signifi cant rise 
in social spending (Besley and Kanbur, 1990; United Nations, 2008). While 
more narrowly-targeted interventions improve the conditions facing some 

1  While studies are available on the experience of Latin American countries, empirical 
research is still lacking to analyse the few cases in Africa where inequality has been reduced 
in recent years.



What can be done to tackle inequalities? 101

disadvantaged groups, as discussed in the next section, gains made through 
targeted interventions alone are unlikely to be sustained without broad-based 
coverage.

In practice, social policies are rarely based on purely universal, or purely 
targeted, approaches. Some measures are universal while others are targeted 
to groups that may be hard to reach through universal measures. Both types 
of spending may be justifi ed, depending on each country’s situation. A policy 
framework grounded in universalism in the provision of essential public services 
but with special measures in implementation can be more effective in reaching 
certain segments of the population that face greater challenges than others in 
overcoming poverty and deprivation.

B.  Reducing social exclusion and intergenerational disadvantage

Universal approaches have proven to be broadly effective in creating 
improvements in overall human capacities and bridging social and economic 
gaps. Their design and implementation has to have a nuanced approach that 
recognises when and how intersecting inequalities lead to the social and 
economic exclusion of particular social and population groups. 

As highlighted by the discussions in Chapter 3 and, especially, in Chapter 4, 
there are particular groups of people in any given society that bear the brunt of 
multiple deprivations. The discussion on such groups in this Report has focused 
on youth, indigenous peoples, older persons, persons with disabilities and 
migrants, and has also shown the poignant gender dimension. Not only do these 
marginalized and disadvantaged social groups fall behind the general population 
in terms of welfare outcomes, they often face inequality of opportunity that 
prevents them from accessing social services, even those that are provided on a 
universal basis. Policymakers should aim at removing the obstacles to their full 
social and economic participation.

A fi rst step towards removing such obstacles is to evaluate why any 
given group faces challenges in their ability to access the services provided. 
Intergenerational poverty traps may make it necessary to keep children at home 
or have them enter the labour force at an early age; it may be that the group’s 
traditionally rural or pastoral way of life kept them in remote areas underserved 
by health, sanitation, educational and other services, or that other infrastructural 
obstacles physically limited their ability to access services. Particular cultural 
norms or language spoken within a group may have kept them out of the 
mainstream or from accessing services. It is also important to examine whether 
discriminatory policies or social norms have created barriers to a group’s full 
participation. 

In many cases, addressing the identifi ed obstacles is about taking the 
services or opportunities to the group, in either the literal or philosophical 
sense. It may mean awareness-raising and information outreach. It may entail 
expansion or decentralization of service provision to reach remote areas. It 



102 Inequality matters

may require investment in infrastructure in underserved locations. It may mean 
training providers in local languages. It may mean sensitization of providers to 
group nuances and needs, and sensitization or retooling of disadvantaged groups 
to be able to utilize the opportunities provided. In other cases, it is about creating 
an enabling legal environment, or eliminating barriers within that environment.

The various approaches taken by some Governments in improving girls’ 
educational attainment are good examples of identifying and addressing 
shortcomings in service access. Countries have instituted a mix of policies 
and programmes including the sensitization and enhancement of training 
for teachers and education offi cials, improved infrastructure, elimination of 
school fees, free textbooks for students from disadvantaged households, and 
providing bicycles and other useful incentives to households. These policies, 
alone or in concert, have enhanced the broader strategy of universal provision 
of education, by identifying the reasons why girls were often left behind 
– such as poor households prioritizing boy children in the apportionment of 
resources – and reducing, or eliminating, those obstacles. These policies have 
been effective wherever they have been implemented, such that most countries 
have reached gender parity in primary school enrolment and made signifi cant 
progress in improving girls’ primary school completion, literacy and secondary 
school enrolment rates (UNESCO, 2012). The lesson here lies in identifying 
successfully ways to increase the use of a universal service by a previously 
underrepresented group.

Governments must also take stock of areas where well-intentioned economic 
and social policies may actually create a situation of deprivation of some groups 
in society. The issue of land tenure and the dispossession of indigenous peoples’ 
traditional lands and territories is an apt example. As noted in Chapter 4, policies 
surrounding land use and access to natural resources have often affected the 
economic and sociocultural stability of indigenous communities adversely. The 
lesson to be taken from these cases is the need for recognising the relationship of 
any given group to particular assets, and working with them to ensure that their 
rights and well-being are not compromised by the allocation or re-allocation of 
these resources. 

Similarly, Governments should evaluate cases where policies may embed 
unjust discrimination. The situation of migrant workers provides a good example 
here. Chapter 3 highlighted that many countries restrict the access of temporary 
immigrants to unemployment benefi ts, health care, education of children and 
various social transfers, even when they work in the formal economy. It is only 
by reversing these policies that we can ensure greater parity between immigrants 
and the local population. In these cases, the lesson to take away is the need to 
identify areas where existing laws create a situation of group disadvantage.

As suggested by the discussion in Chapter 4, a focus on social groups and 
their rates of participation in social and economic life will not just enhance 
the reach and effectiveness of universal social policies, but will address 



What can be done to tackle inequalities? 103

inequalities where they intersect most heavily, helping to reduce their long-term, 
intergenerational impacts. 

C.  Social protection

One positive development in the international public policy discourse in the 
past decade has been the renewed emphasis on universal social protection as a 
necessary – and desirable – form of social transfer. Social protection is a concept 
integral to the Welfare State, which has been most effective in protecting people 
from poverty and in keeping inequality in check. It refers to policies that ensure 
basic income security, in the form of various social transfers (in cash or in kind), 
such as pensions for older persons, income support for persons with disabilities 
and families with children, and employment guarantees and services for the 
unemployed and working poor. Basic social protection has become even more 
imperative for ensuring that individuals do not slip into poverty as a result of 
loss of employment, poor health or external shocks. While these measures do not 
guarantee the possibility of equality of outcomes, they ensure that the rungs of 
the social mobility ladder are not too far apart. They ensure that opportunities 
to participate in the social, economic and political activities are distributed more 
widely.

Recent assessments of the Latin American experience indicate that, in 
order to shift income distribution effectively in a progressive direction, cash 
transfer programmes must cover a high proportion of the extreme poor, and such 
spending must be large enough so that transfers per benefi ciary closely match 
the poverty gap – that is, the average distance between the poverty line and the 
per capita income of the poor (Lustig, 2012). 

It is important to highlight that basic social protection, such as the type 
considered in the Social Protection Floor Initiative, can be kept within a relatively 
modest percentage of national income even in severely resource-constrained 
countries. The Bachelet Report on the social protection fl oor (ILO, 2011) found 
that, in countries like Benin, El Salvador, Mozambique and Viet Nam, universal 
social protection fl oor programmes would only cost between 1 and 2 per cent of 
GDP. This is small compared to the tax revenues often forgone by not collecting 
revenue effectively from the wealthy and by not tackling ineffi ciencies that exist 
in many expenditure programmes. 

Effective country-specifi c social protection fl oors which can gradually 
expand are affordable in most countries and can—in the long run—be 
sustainable fi nancially by expanding the tax base, through more sustained 
growth resulting from enhanced labour productivity, the resilience of society 
and the stability of the polity. What is especially signifi cant right now is that, 
apart from reducing human insecurity and gender gaps, this strategy can have 
important macroeconomic benefi ts. It increases the presence of countercyclical 
buffers reducing the negative effects of economic downswings. By buttressing 
aggregate demand, it actually provides a positive way out of the downward 



104 Inequality matters

cycle of fi scal austerity and social unrest that now seems to be a common curse 
in many countries (UNCTAD, 2011). It also facilitates the transition to a greener 
economy, by cushioning the impact of necessary structural changes on poverty 
and inequality while also facilitating skill retraining. 

Despite these clear advantages, the majority of the world population still 
has no access to social protection. The challenge now is to build on existing 
safety-net schemes, to move towards more universal coverage based on a social 
protection fl oor that is affordable, and that can be expanded progressively as a 
country’s resources allow. 

D.  Investing in education and strengthening labour-market institutions

Increasing investment in education and ensuring that macroeconomic 
policies support employment creation is important to reducing inequalities: 
these policies have played a central role in the rapid industrialization cases 
of recent decades. For example, the higher educational levels of farmers and 
their children in both the Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China, a 
long-term by-product of land reform (Lim, forthcoming), contributed to their 
fast industrialization. In just one decade, in the 1970s, enrolment in primary, 
secondary and tertiary education in the Republic of Korea rose by factors of 
two, eight and ten, respectively. In addition to increasing their receptivity to new 
agricultural technology and crops, this provided the social basis of an educated 
workforce for the industrial sector, upward social mobility, and social and 
political stability. It contributed to signifi cant reductions in wage inequalities in 
the subsequent decade, when the fruits of this expansion in education became 
evident. 

A similar process is currently under way in Latin America, one of the most 
unequal regions in the world and also one characterized by high wage inequalities. 
Wage gaps between skilled and unskilled workers have come down in many 
countries in the region over the past decade. The widespread drop in the skill 
premium in the 2000s in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Peru (which contributed to 
the recent drop in income inequality) can be attributed to increases in educational 
access and enrolment (Cornia, forthcoming).  This process has been facilitated 
by an increase in the supply of skilled workers due to greater educational efforts 
by Governments and a parallel decline in the supply of unskilled labour due to 
demographic factors. Widening access to education and ensuring more female 
enrolment in schools will also reduce gender wage gaps.

Labour market institutions play an important role in moderating wage 
inequalities. These include labour unions, employment protection, minimum wages, 
unemployment benefi ts and regulation with respect to fi ring practices. The decline in 
union membership rates in several countries since the 1950s has been accompanied 
by a sharp rise in wage inequality. In the United States, for example, the decline in 
rates of unionization in the 1970s and 1980s explains between 10 to 20 per cent 
of the increase in wage inequality among men (Koeniger, Leonardi and Nunziata, 



What can be done to tackle inequalities? 105

2004; Freeman, 2005; Card, 2001). Conversely, in parts of Latin America, the active 
attempts to revive labour market institutions and reintroduce collective bargaining 
have served to reduce wage inequalities among those in regular employment 
(Marinakis, 2011). From a policy standpoint, it would, therefore, be important 
to consider mechanisms that protect collective bargaining institutions. Such 
institutions have been shown to have an equalizing effect on wage dispersion across 
skill groups, particularly among male unionized workers in the middle of the skill 
distribution (Card, Lemieux and Riddell, 2003; Freeman, 1980). However, unions 
organized around the traditional employer-employee relationship are not well-suited 
for giving voice to those who do not work for a wage, or who do so outside the 
formal sector (World Bank, 2012b). The growing incidence of informal and non-
standard forms of employment has created momentum for the establishment of 
innovative institutions, such as associations of self-employed workers.

In addition, institutional changes, such as an increase in minimum wage, 
can be very important in reducing wage inequalities (UNCTAD, 2012). In much 
of the Latin American region, legal minimum wages rose through most of the 
2000s and, in some countries like Brazil, more than doubled in real terms (Cornia, 
2012). Increasing the minimum wage and its more effective enforcement 
constitute another signifi cant strategy for improving wage distribution. This is 
often particularly important for women workers, who tend to be clustered at 
the lower end of the wage distribution, around the minimum wage. Increases in 
minimum wage have proved to be signifi cant in reducing gender gaps in wages 
in Argentina, for example (Ministry of Labour, Argentina, 2012). 

All these processes are greatly assisted by extending the coverage of 
social protection and decent work standards to informal workers. Since 
informality is essentially linked to the absence of basic labour protection, it 
should be resisted. Some countries have managed to increase minimum wages 
while simultaneously increasing the number and share of workers in formal 
activities and, once again, there are positive examples from Latin America 
(Marinakis, 2011; ECLAC, 2012).

E.  Fiscal and monetary policies to reduce inequality

Fiscal and monetary policies affect inequality not only because they have 
a bearing on income distribution, but also through their role in resource 
mobilization for social investment. The manner in which Government policy 
affects the distribution of income and wealth depends on the level and 
composition of public spending and taxation. The magnitude of their impact 
will depend on how progressive the tax system is (income and property taxes 
are usually progressive, while indirect taxes are regressive as they put greater 
proportionate burden on the middle classes and poor households) and on how 
much the poor benefi t from social transfers and social insurance. The negative 
effect of indirect taxes on the income of people living in poverty or near poor 
can be stronger than the positive effect of cash transfers (Lustig, 2012). 



106 Inequality matters

Fiscal policies can reduce inequality through progressive income taxation 
and highly-redistributive social transfers targeting education and health 
spending, as well as public child- and old-age benefi ts. The impact of such 
transfers on inequality can be quite signifi cant. The experience of 25 OECD 
countries during the period 1985 to 2005 has shown that direct income taxes 
and public cash transfers reduced the average Gini coeffi cient by about one 
third (Bastagli, Coady and Gupta, 2012). Thereafter, fi scal policies have not had 
equally levelling effects in OECD countries, as the redistributive impact of fi scal 
policy has failed to correct the trend of rising income inequality. 

As was observed in Chapter 1, in many countries the redistributive effects 
of fi scal policy, including tax policies, have not been strong enough to counter 
rising income inequality in recent years, as tax policies have allowed the 
wealthy to retain a higher proportion of their incomes and have become less 
progressive by relying on indirect taxes. In some advanced economies such as 
the United States, a major ongoing debate is about the level at which capital 
gains and dividends should be taxed in order to reduce the contribution of such 
income to the sharp rise in income inequality (Hungerford, 2013). While in 
developed countries political economy changes may have led to the shift away 
from progressive to more regressive fi scal policies, in developing countries the 
problems may be somewhat different. The ability of poor countries to curtail 
inequality through redistributive fi scal policy measures is more likely to be 
constrained by low levels of revenue collection, associated with a narrow tax 
base and lack of diversifi cation. Typically, this situation is compounded further 
by high levels of informality and weak tax administrations, tax havens and 
capital fl ight, among other issues.

In countries where natural-resource extraction is an important economic 
activity, there is often signifi cant scope for altering the distribution of the rents 
from such resources in favour of the public exchequer. The recent changes in 
the royalty structures of oil revenues of Ecuador, Bolivia and Venezuela, for 
example, are instructive in this regard. 

The impact of any of these measures on the level of inequality is likely 
to differ across countries depending on initial conditions, social structures, 
productive asset ownership patterns, the quality of public institutions, and the 
level of social spending. In many cases, when there are large differences in 
social spending between countries, the effectiveness of fi scal policy in reducing 
inequality will also differ signifi cantly.

The feasibility of implementing such policies also hinges on national 
attitudes regarding the role of markets in determining rewards for individual 
effort, and the perceived role of the State in setting labour standards such as 
minimum wages, pursuing progressive redistributive policies (that is, taxes paid 
and transfers received), and promoting policies that foster sustained, inclusive 
and equitable economic growth and structural transformation. 

The role of monetary policy in both income and consumption inequality 



What can be done to tackle inequalities? 107

has received relatively little attention in the economics literature. Yet, the 
control of interest rates and the availability of credit can affect levels and 
patterns of inequality (Coeuré, 2012; Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012; Galbraith, 
Giovanni and Russo, 2007).  For example, if expansionary monetary policy 
causes business income to outpace growth in labour income, inequality would 
have worsened in terms of the composition of income (Coibion, and others, 
2012). Similarly, monetary policy can compound income inequality through 
fi nancial segmentation, should the latter benefi t disproportionately those in 
the fi nancial-services sector and households that receive a signifi cant share of 
their income from capital gains and dividends (Williamson, 2009; Ledoit, 2009; 
Atkinson, 2001). Monetary policy could also worsen inequality through the 
portfolio channel when central banks’ policies generate infl ation, which tends 
to affect low-income households negatively and disproportionately, since they 
are more predisposed than upper-income households to hold a large proportion 
of their fi nancial wealth in cash (Albanesi, 2007; Coeuré, 2012). Conversely, 
actions taken by the central bank to curtail infl ation by raising interest rates and 
restricting access to credit in a blanket fashion can cause particular hardship to 
small borrowers. Identifying such factors should help inform policy responses 
targeting the recent upsurge in income inequality. 

F.  Creating more and better-paying jobs

It was shown in Chapter 1 that wage shares of national income have been 
falling over the past two decades in the majority of countries in both developed 
and developing regions. This has been commonly attributed to the impact of 
globalization (which has drawn more workers in different countries into the 
pool available for global production, and reduced the bargaining power of 
workers because of the greater mobility of capital) and technological changes 
that have reduced demand – particularly for less-skilled labour. However, the 
counter-experiences of an, admittedly, small number of countries (mostly in 
Latin America), as well as the earlier experience of East Asian countries in  
their phase of rapid industrialization, show that it is possible to maintain, or 
increase, wage shares of income. Already, improvements in the wages of both 
skilled and non-skilled workers in major emerging economies have contributed 
to lifting millions of people out of poverty. This experience also shows that a 
progressive shift from agriculture to manufacturing and services, accompanied 
by improvements in educational attainment, will result in higher wages, and is 
likely to reduce the income gap between workers in advanced economies and 
those in developing countries.

Several factors have been cited as responsible for the decline in the wage 
share of national income globally: technological progress (including structural 
change), globalization, fi nancialization, and Welfare State retrenchment 
(Stockhammer, 2012; Galbraith, 2012). Several of these factors can be addressed 
by domestic and international policies. Wages would have to be perceived, not 
just as a cost of production, but as a major source of aggregate demand, 



108 Inequality matters

such that rising wage bills can actually propel economic recovery in slumps, 
and generate conditions for stable growth (UNCTAD, 2012). There are three 
elements of the aggregate wage share that are relevant in this regard, and policies 
must be concerned with all of them: the level of employment, wages relative to 
productivity changes within production, and the remuneration of self-employed 
workers, who constitute an increasing share of workers in many countries. 

The inability of economic growth to create suffi cient decent work to meet 
the requirements of the labour force is a major part of the problem (ILO, 2012c). 
Reducing inequality requires policies that foster dynamic structural change to 
increase shares of higher productivity activities, especially in poor countries. 

The countries that have experienced recent increases in the wage share 
of national income have also increased their levels of formal employment 
in general. This has not necessarily occurred through additional, private 
employment-generation only. In much of Latin America in the 2000s, there have 
been signifi cant increases in public employment, through the expansion and 
qualitative improvement in public services in areas such as health and education, 
as well as through insourcing activities that had been outsourced previously by 
Governments to private companies (Keifman and Maurizio, forthcoming). 

Wages, in many societies, have not increased in line with labour-productivity 
increases. Ensuring that wages increase along with labour productivity is 
important in stabilizing primary income distribution as well as in enabling a 
recovery from the continuing global economic crisis (UNCTAD, 2011; 2012). In 
those countries where the greater part of employment is informal and the labour 
force is dominated by self-employed workers, the policy focus has to be on 
increasing the productivity and remuneration of such activities. In industrialized 
countries, there has been an increasing trend towards fl exibilization, leading 
to more workers in informal contracts or in vulnerable self-employment. This 
makes particularly important the policies designed to improve conditions for 
non-conventional forms of work and access by small-scale producers to credit 
on affordable terms, inputs, technology and markets. 

A major part of non-wage incomes have been appropriated by returns to 
fi nancial activities, and it has become evident that not all of this is benefi cial 
to economies and global fi nancial stability. The association of fi nancialization 
with economic instability is now well-known. Furthermore, the contribution to 
income inequality of fi nancial sector bonuses to higher-end employees, and the 
rising concentration of assets and interest and dividend incomes associated with 
the growth of the fi nancial sector as a share of GNI has being noted (Hungerford, 
2013). Therefore, bringing fi nancial returns back to normal historical levels, 
when fi nancial markets used to thrive with innovation – but also had incentives 
to fulfi l their core function of intermediating savings towards productive 
investment – will help reduce income inequality. A similar, positive role can be 
played by strategies to curb excessive concentration of ownership or control that 
cause rents from land and other resources to accrue to a small section of society.

G.  Reducing asset inequalities

As argued in Chapter 3, high asset inequalities constrain the development 
potential of a society. By the same token, asset redistribution can play an 
important—even critical—role in assisting the process of development. For 
example, radical land redistribution in the Republic of Korea and Taiwan 
Province of China destroyed the economic and political base of the land-owning 
oligarchies. This enabled the emergence and operation of relatively autonomous 
States that were able to enact developmental policies that transcended narrow 
interests (Lim, 2013; Ranis, Fei and Kuo 1979; Amsden, 1989). In order to 
be successful, attempts at land reform should be combined with broader rural 
development strategies and complementary measures, such as access to credit 
and inputs for farmers, as well as broad-based access to good-quality educational 
and decent work opportunities.   

There is a substantial concentration of other productive and—especially—
fi nancial assets both within most countries as well as internationally. In both 
developed and developing countries, there is great potential for enhancing 
tax revenues through more progressive taxation, that is, for increasing taxes 
on top earners and corporations. Piketty, Saez and Stantcheva (2011) fi nd that, 
in a majority of OECD countries, current income tax rates are signifi cantly 
below those at which the total tax yield would be maximized. So reducing the 
personal and corporate concentration of assets is an important area of public 
intervention to promote social development. 

Gender differences remain an important source of inequality in most 
societies regarding asset ownership and control. The gender discrimination 
inherent in property and inheritance laws needs to be overturned, and this is all 
the more urgent because often, such discrimination is combined with unequal 
gender access to education and gainful employment, enlarging the gap in 
economic conditions between men and women and reducing the social status 
of women further.

III.  The international framework and the post-2015 
       global development agenda

Inequality has been raised as a major social concern by many stakeholders in the 
discussions on sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development 
agenda. An initial report on the consultations facilitated by the United Nations 
started in August 2012 on a new development agenda revealed a sense that 
inequalities were growing and that small elites were benefi ting from development 
and growth at the expense of the majority (United Nations Development Group, 
2013). The Secretary-General acknowledged these concerns as he noted, in 
his report to the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly on accelerating 
progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and advancing the 



110 Inequality matters

Post-2015 Development Agenda, the need for transformative action to tackle 
exclusion and inequality: 

In order to leave no one behind and bring everyone forward, actions are needed 
to promote equality of opportunity. This implies inclusive economies in which 
men and women have access to decent employment, legal identifi cation, fi nancial 
services, infrastructure and social protection, as well as societies where all people 
can contribute and participate in national and local governance.2 

The report of the High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons advising the 
Secretary-General on the Post-2015 Development Agenda recommended 
tackling inequality of opportunity (in access to health, education, nutrition and 
other vital services) as well as other aspects of inequality relevant for social 
inclusion, such as security of tenure and access to justice.3 The Panel proposed 
that targets would only be considered as achieved if they were met for all relevant 
social and income groups. Thus, the Panel called for integrating equality of 
opportunity into all relevant goals and targets. Regarding income inequality, 
however, the Panel noted that: 

… national policy in each country, not global goal-setting, must provide the 
answer. History also shows that countries tend to have cycles in their income 
inequality as conventionally measured; and countries differ widely both in their 
view of what levels of income inequality are acceptable and in the strategies they 
adopt to reduce it.4 

The analysis provided in this Report indicates that most of the world’s 
poor, and those who belong to marginalized groups, are in highly-disadvantaged 
starting positions which impede their ability to capitalize on opportunities. 
Focusing only on the symptoms of poverty or exclusion (such as access to 
education or health), rather than on their structural causes, has often led to narrow, 
discretionary measures aimed at addressing short-term needs. Without attention to 
the underlying economic, social and spatial causes of poverty and inequality, the 
post-2015 development agenda may not help to level the playing fi eld. 

Other proposals have advocated the inclusion of a self-standing goal on 
inequality. For instance, a proposal made by a group of 90 academics and 
development experts in a letter to the High-Level Panel in March 2013 encouraged 
the inclusion of a goal to reduce gaps within countries, with a focus on income and 
gender inequalities.5 Thus, the proposal is to go beyond equalizing opportunities

to addressing outcomes. While a goal on inequality may help raise awareness and 
gather political support to address it, focusing exclusively on income inequality 
is also limited. Higher income does not translate systematically into better access 
to health, education and nutrition or participation in political and social life. As 
shown in the present report, a focus on intersecting inequalities makes it clear that 
economic, sociopolitical and spatial inequalities can have cumulative, mutually-
reinforcing effects that contribute to the systematic disadvantage of some social 
groups and to the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Focusing on income 
redistribution alone may not be suffi cient to redress systematic disadvantage. 

The experience of the Millennium Development Goals suggests that 
addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality may require moving 
beyond goals and targets, to incorporating recommendations on the policy 
instruments that are required to ensure more equitable opportunities and 
outcomes. As discussed in this report, these include strategies with respect 
to asset and income distribution, fi scal policies, employment and labour-
market policies, social policies (especially universal provision of good quality 
education, health and social protection), access to infrastructure and basic 
amenities, and special attention to particularly disadvantaged groups, including 
ensuring their voice and access to legal redress. It is obvious that, while these 
must be implemented at the national level, the international community must 
play a major role in providing support to such policies. The most important 
aspect of such international cooperation will be an enabling environment where 
global governance structures and international organizations are supportive of 
progressive social and economic policies within countries and across regions.     

In practice, and regardless of the format, integrating inequalities in the goals 
would require that targets and indicators refer explicitly to different groups of 
the population, with clear focus on the poorest and most marginalized. In its 
report on statistics and indicators, the United Nations Task Team on the Post-
2015 Development Agenda proposed the use of independent sets of indicators 
for each group or area of interest, so that indicators could be tailored fl exibly to 
the needs and priorities of each group.6 This approach would require improved 
national statistics and indicators to capture disparities. Some of the existing 
survey tools and programmes already allow the data disaggregation necessary 
to generate equality-adjusted indicators. Strengthening such programmes and 
expanding data collection to capture all population groups will be critical. The 
importance of the monitoring framework should not be discounted: the way 
in which it is defi ned, and the type of disaggregation used, will infl uence the 
political debate, the focus of programmes and interventions, and the outcome of 
the development efforts.

112 Inequality matters

A fi nal consideration is that opportunities in life depend largely on an 
individual’s country of residence. Not only are inequalities across countries 
larger than national inequalities, but improvements in information and 
communications technologies are heightening the awareness of international 
inequalities. Addressing international inequalities requires broadening the scope 
of the global partnership for development. The international trade agenda must 
support measures targeted towards equalizing opportunities for participation 
in global markets, and trade agreements should be harmonized with other 
multilateral agreements in social development so as to form a more coherent, 
integrated approach. The recent global fi nancial and economic crisis call for 
a more effective regulatory system for international fi nancial markets. There 
is scope for further policy coordination across countries in other areas as well, 
namely, migration and foreign direct investment. Overall, in an increasingly 
global economy, emphasis must be placed on the equitable distribution of 
benefi ts and on the prevention and management of fi nancial and economic crises. 

IV. Conclusion

It can be concluded from the analysis in the present Report that inequality 
should, and can, be reduced. 

While there is no single policy approach to combating growing inequalities, 
there is scope for action. In particular, addressing inequality and promoting 
sustained, equitable and inclusive growth requires that issues of employment 
creation, social protection and redistribution be placed at the centre of social 
and economic policymaking. Both social and macroeconomic policies should 
work in tandem to promote growth together with decent jobs to reduce poverty, 
inequality and social exclusion. In addition, social investments–especially in 
education and health, redistributive fi scal policy and innovative mechanisms for 
social dialogue amidst declining unionization–should be accorded priority

At the national level, one critical strategy is that of ensuring universal 
access to good-quality, basic goods and services. Within such universal policies, 
it is important to ensure that provision reaches the sections of the population 
that are, typically, excluded. It is particularly necessary to recognise, address 
and work to reduce, or eliminate, the existing structures of discrimination and 
exclusion typically related to gender, ethnic and other divisions, regional or 
locational characteristics, or personal features such as age or disability. This 
underscores the call made in this present Report on the World Social Situation 
for the integration of universalism, and specifi c interventions in social policy 
that will entail affi rmative action, public investment in underserved areas and 
sectors, equal access to resources by all, and a conscious understanding of how 
policies are implemented on the ground with reference to economic, social, 
legal, environmental, administrative and cultural realities. 

Desirable social policies need to work hand-in-hand with macroeconomic 



What can be done to tackle inequalities? 113

strategies, not only to avoid the policy inconsistencies sometimes observed, 
but also to secure adequate fi nancial resources for social policy to be effective. 
Tax policies that seek to improve collection from sectors and agents that have 
benefi ted disproportionately from income growth do not necessarily require 
higher tax rates: better—and more effective—implementation of existing tax 
laws and closing tax loopholes can be even more effective, as some recent 
examples from Latin America, and elsewhere, indicate. Recently, international 
coordination on these matters has gained acceptance. In addition, monetary and 
fi nancial policies need to be re-oriented towards the supervision and regulation 
of fi nancial markets and the creation of incentives in the fi nancial system to 
achieve not only economic stability but also socially-desired goals such as 
greater fi nancial inclusion, by supporting microcredit, micro insurance and 
microfi nance. Once again, international support for such measures is necessary, 
given the—much greater—global integration of fi nance today. 

Policies to promote employment diversifi cation and livelihood sustainability 
are crucial to addressing inequality. It is important to emphasise policies that 
increase decent work for all. In low-income countries, particular focus should 
be placed on economic diversifi cation to enable the shift of workers to less-
vulnerable and better-remunerated jobs with safe and healthy working conditions. 
Recognizing, and redressing, inequalities in wages that are generated not just by 
types of work, but by patterns of social discrimination and segmented labour 
markets, are also needed.

The ongoing multi-stakeholder consultations to craft the post-2015 global 
development agenda are taking concerns about inequality into consideration. 
The analysis and policy conclusions contained in this Report can provide useful 
inputs to the debate. Inequality matters: it must be addressed; Policy matters: 
inequality can be reduced.
