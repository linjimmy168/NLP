The State of  

Food Insecurity in the World 

Strengthening the enabling environment  
for food security and nutrition



 J  The latest FAO estimates indicate that 

global hunger reduction continues: about 

805 million people are estimated to be 

chronically undernourished in 2012–14, 

down more than 100 million over the last 

decade, and 209 million lower than in 

1990–92. In the same period, the prevalence 

of undernourishment has fallen from 18.7 

to 11.3 percent globally and from 23.4 to 

13.5 percent for the developing countries.

 J  The hunger target of the Millennium 

Development Goal 1c (MDG 1c) – of halving 

the proportion of undernourished people 

in developing countries by 2015 – is within 

reach. However, the developing world is 

not on track to achieve the World Food 

Summit (WFS) target of halving the number 

of undernourished people by next year. 

 J  Despite overall progress, marked 

differences across regions persist. 

Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest 

prevalence of undernourishment, with 

only modest progress in recent years. 

Around one in four people in the region 

remains undernourished. Asia, the most 

populous region in the world, still has 

the highest number of undernourished. 

Southern Asia has made slow progress 

in hunger reduction, while more rapid 

progress has been achieved in Eastern 

and South-Eastern Asia with the latter 

having already met the WFS hunger 

target. Latin America and the Caribbean, 

as a whole, met the MDG1 hunger 

target while Latin America has achieved 

the more stringent WFS target.

 J  Since 1990–92, 63 developing countries 

have reached the MDG hunger target 

and 25 countries have achieved the more 

stringent WFS target. Of the 63 developing 

countries that have achieved the MDG 

hunger target, 11 countries have maintained 

the prevalence of undernourishment 

below 5 percent since 1990–92.

 J  Sustained political commitment at 

the highest level is a prerequisite for 

hunger eradication. It entails placing 

food security and nutrition at the top 

of the political agenda and creating an 

enabling environment for improving 

food security and nutrition through 

adequate investments, better policies, legal 

frameworks, stakeholder participation 

and a strong evidence base. Institutional 

reforms are also needed to promote 

and sustain progress. Regions as well as 

countries have strengthened their political 

commitment to food security and nutrition.

 J  Hunger reduction requires an integrated 

approach, which would include: public and 

private investments to raise agricultural 

productivity; better access to inputs, 

land, services, technologies and markets; 

measures to promote rural development; 

social protection for the most vulnerable, 

including strengthening their resilience 

to conflicts and natural disasters; and 

specific nutrition programmes, especially 

to address micronutrient deficiencies 

in mothers and children under five.

W hen the 69th United Nations General Assembly begins its General Debate on 23 September 2014, 464 days will remain to the end of 2015, the target date for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). 
A stock-taking of where we stand on reducing hunger and malnutrition shows that progress in 

hunger reduction at the global level has continued but that food insecurity is still a challenge to 
be conquered. 

The latest estimates show that, since 1990–92, the prevalence of undernourishment has fallen 
from 18.7 to 11.3 percent in 2012–14 for the world as a whole, and from 23.4 to 13.5 percent 
for the developing regions. The global MDG target 1c of reducing by half the proportion of 
undernourished people is within reach, if appropriate and immediate efforts are stepped up. Not 
only is MDG 1c within reach at the global level, but it has already been achieved by many 
countries. Sixty-three developing countries have already reached the target, 11 of which have 
maintained the prevalence of undernourishment below 5 percent since 1990–92, while another 
six are on track to do so by 2015. Twenty-five of the 63 countries have also accomplished the 
more ambitious 1996 World Food Summit (WFS) goal of halving the number of chronically 
underfed people. 

Since 1990–92, the number of hungry people has fallen by over 200 million. This is proof that 
we can win the war against hunger and should inspire countries to move forward, with the 
assistance of the international community as needed, by finding individual sets of action that 
respond to their national needs and specificities. This is the first step to achieving the other 
MDGs.

Despite this progress, however, the number of hungry people in the world is still unacceptably 
high: at least 805 million people, or one in nine, worldwide do not have enough to eat. Global 
trends in hunger reduction mask disparities within and among regions.

While Northern Africa has had a consistently low prevalence of hunger at less than 5 percent, 
in sub-Saharan Africa, one in four people remain chronically hungry. Reversing this trend is our 
greatest challenge and requires transforming into concrete progress the growing political will in 
the region shown by the commitment made at the June 2014 African Union Summit to end 
hunger by 2025. 

The sheer size of Asia makes it a region of extremes: 217 million Asians have overcome hunger 
since 1990–92; yet, it is still the region where two-thirds of the world’s hungry live. Significant 
reductions in global hunger numbers require even greater progress in the region. While the MDG 
hunger target has already been achieved in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, hunger prevalence in 
Southern Asia has declined, but insufficiently, since 1990–92. 

Latin America and the Caribbean is the region that has shown the greatest progress in hunger 
reduction, with the prevalence of hunger reduced by almost two-thirds since the early 1990s. As 
a whole, it has already reached the MDG hunger target and is very close to meeting the WFS 
target. Government-led efforts combining support for production with social protection have 
been supported by much wider commitment: societies have decided to end hunger; parliaments 
are taking responsibility, and national efforts have been pushed forward by the strong 
commitment of the region as a whole that became the first region to commit to the goal of zero 
hunger by adopting the Hunger-Free Latin America and the Caribbean Initiative 2025 nearly ten 
years ago – a commitment reaffirmed by the region’s leaders at recent Summits of the 
Community of Latin America and the Caribbean States (CELAC).

A most welcome message emerging from this year’s report is that accelerated, substantial and 
sustainable hunger reduction is possible with the requisite political commitment. This has to be 
well informed by sound understanding of national challenges, relevant policy options, broad 
participation and lessons from other experiences. This year’s report includes seven case studies 
that summarize how and to what extent some countries have sought to create an “enabling 
environment for food security and nutrition”.

Food insecurity and malnutrition are complex problems that cannot be solved by one sector or 
stakeholder alone, but need to be tackled in a coordinated way, with the necessary political 
commitment and integrated leadership. A critical appreciation of lessons learned is essential for 
hunger reduction. 

We, as heads of the Rome-based food and agriculture agencies, will continue working with 
our member countries to support their efforts to accelerate progress in improving food security 
and nutrition by strengthening their capacities and capabilities to realize their commitments to 
make hunger a part of history and not of our future.

Undernourishment around the world in 2014 

Progress in hunger reduction continues 

The latest FAO estimates indicate that the trend in global hunger reduction continues. About 805 million people were estimated to be chronically 
undernourished in 2012–14, down by more than 100 million 
over the last decade and by 209 million since 1990–92. 
However, about one in every nine people in the world still has 
insufficient food for an active and healthy life. The vast 
majority of these undernourished people live in developing 
countries, where an estimated 791 million were chronically 
hungry in 2012–14. Although developing countries also 

account for most of the improvements over the last two 
decades – with an overall reduction of 203 million 
undernourished people since 1990–92 – about one in eight 
people in these regions, or 13.5 percent of the overall 
population, remain chronically underfed (Table 1). 
Considerable efforts are therefore still needed to reach the 
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) hunger target by 2015, 
especially in countries that have registered inadequate 
progress.

Undernourishment around the world in 2014

While the MDG hunger target seems to be within reach 
globally, there is not enough time to achieve the World Food 
Summit (WFS) target of halving the number of 
undernourished people by 2015. 

Despite the progress in developing regions as a whole, 
large differences remain across regions (Figures 2 and 3). In 
general, in Africa, there has been insufficient progress 
towards international hunger targets, especially in the sub-
Saharan region, where more than one in four people remain 
undernourished – the highest prevalence of any region in the 
world. Nevertheless, the prevalence of undernourishment in 
sub-Saharan Africa has declined from 33.3 percent in 1990–
92 to 23.8 percent in 2012–14. Growing political 
commitment to promote food security in Africa is being 
transformed into concrete results. Strong economic growth 
(7 of the 10 fast-growing economies in the world are in 
Africa) is improving the living conditions of its growing 
population. There is greater recognition of the importance of 
ensuring peace and stability, the lack of which has been both 
cause and consequence of conflict that risks thwarting 
efforts to fight hunger in many countries in Africa. The 
situation is different in Northern Africa, which has a far 
lower hunger burden, with the prevalence of 
undernourishment consistently less than 5 percent since 
1990. The apparent abrupt increase in 2012–14 (Figures 3 

The MDG hunger target is within reach…

The decline in the share of hungry people has been more 
impressive than the reduction in absolute numbers. Between 
1990–92 and 2012–14, the prevalence of undernourishment 
has fallen from 18.7 percent to 11.3 percent at the global 
level, and from 23.4 percent to 13.5 percent in developing 
countries. This means that the MDG 1c hunger target of 
halving the proportion of undernourished people by 2015 is 
within reach. If the current trend of a reduction of about

efforts, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern and

and 4) is due to the addition of the Sudan to the Northern 
Africa region.1 

Asia as a whole has a prevalence of undernourishment of 
12.7 percent, corresponding to 526 million people, or an 
eighth of the region’s population, chronically lacking access to 
enough food. As the most populous region in the world, Asia 
is home to two out of three of the world’s undernourished 
people. Overall, it is close to reaching the MDG 1c hunger 
target, but there are large differences across its subregions. 
Eastern and South-Eastern Asia have already met the target, 
having cut their undernutrition rates by more than half and 
more than two-thirds respectively. The Caucasus and Central 
Asia are also on track to reach the goal by 2015, while lack of 
progress in Southern and Western Asia makes it unlikely that 
these regions can achieve MDG 1c. 

Hunger continues to take its largest toll in Southern Asia, 
where population growth is high. The estimate of 
276 million chronically undernourished people in 2012–14 is 
only marginally lower than the number at the beginning of 

the MDG process. Although the prevalence of 
undernourishment has declined from 24.0 percent in  
1990–92 to 15.8 percent in 2012–14, progress is still too 
slow to allow Southern Asia to reach the MDG target by 
2015. The situation is worse in Western Asia, where the 
prevalence of undernourishment actually increased from 
6.3 percent in 1990–92 to 8.7 percent in 2012–14, largely 
owing to political instability and the deterioration in overall 
economic conditions during recent years. 

To date, Latin America and the Caribbean – the first 
region to publically commit to eradicate hunger by 2025 – 
has the most successful developing region record in 
increasing food security. It has already met the MDG target 
by a comfortable margin and is close to the WFS summit 
target. Much of the success results from rapid hunger 
reduction in Latin America, which has reached the WFS 
target, while the Caribbean has seen slower progress in 
fighting undernourishment so far. For the region as a whole, 
the prevalence of undernourishment has declined to

6.1 percent – representing little more than one-third of its 
hunger burden in the early 1990s. 

Of all the developing regions, Oceania currently has the 
lowest number of undernourished people. However, despite 
the low overall burden of hunger in the region, this number 
has increased over the last two decades, while the 
prevalence of undernourishment has only registered a very 

modest reduction: estimates place undernourishment at 
14.0 percent in 2012–14, only 1.7 percentage points below 
the level for 1990–92. An additional cause for concern is 
that rising undernourishment in Oceania has been 
accompanied by a growing burden of overweight and 
obesity, exposing the region to a significant double burden 
of malnutrition.

Undernourishment around the world in 2014

•	 The latest estimates indicate that 805 million 
people – about one in nine of the world’s 
population – were chronically undernourished in 
2012–14, with insufficient food for an active and 
healthy life. This number represents a decline of 
more than 100 million people over the last 
decade and of 209 million since 1990–92. 

•	 The vast majority of hungry people live in 
developing regions, which saw a 42 percent 
reduction in the prevalence of undernourished 
people between 1990–92 and 2012–14. Despite 
this progress, about one in eight people, or 
13.5 percent of the overall population, remain 
chronically undernourished in these regions, 
down from 23.4 percent in 1990–92. 

•	 The MDG 1c hunger target – of halving, by 2015, 
the proportion of undernourished people in the 
developing world – is within reach, but 
considerable efforts are immediately needed, 
particularly in countries where progress has stalled. 

Key findings

•	 Despite overall progress, large differences 
remain across developing regions. Eastern and 
South-Eastern Asia have already achieved the 
MDG hunger target. The same is true of Latin 
America and the Caribbean, while the 
Caucasus and Central Asia are on track to 
reach MDG 1c by 2015. Latin America and the 
Caribbean is also on track to reach the more 
ambitious WFS goal. By contrast, sub-Saharan 
Africa and Southern and Western Asia have 
registered insufficient progress to reach the 
MDG target. Sub-Saharan Africa has become 
home to more than a quarter of the world’s 
undernourished people, owing to an increase 
of 38 million in the number of hungry people 
since 1990–92.

Beyond undernourishment: insights from 
the suite of food security indicators 

Food security is a complex phenomenon that manifests itself in numerous physical conditions resulting from multiple causes. The WFS of 1996 
established four dimensions of food security: availability, 
access, stability and utilization. The State of Food Insecurity 
in the World 2013 introduced a suite of indicators 
organized around these four dimensions with a view to 
overcoming the drawbacks that arise from relying solely on 
the prevalence of undernourishment indicator.2 By 
measuring food security across its four dimensions, the 
suite of indicators (presented in Annex 2) provides a more 
comprehensive picture, and can also help in targeting and 
prioritizing food security and nutrition policies. 

The availability dimension captures not only the quantity, 
but also the quality and diversity of food. Indicators for 
assessing availability include the adequacy of dietary energy 
supply; the share of calories derived from cereals, roots and 
tubers; the average protein supply; the average supply of 
animal-source proteins; and the average value of food 
production.

The access dimension comprises indicators of physical 
access and infrastructure such as railway and road density; 
economic access, represented by the domestic food price 

index; and the prevalence of undernourishment. 
The stability dimension is divided into two groups. The 

first group covers factors that measure exposure to food 
security risk with a diverse set of indicators such as the 
cereal dependency ratio, the area under irrigation, and the 
value of staple food imports as a percentage of total 
merchandise exports. The second group focuses on the 
incidence of shocks such as domestic food price volatility, 
fluctuations in domestic food supply, and political 
instability. 

The utilization dimension also falls into two groups. The 
first encompasses variables that determine the ability to 
utilize food, notably indicators of access to water and 
sanitation. The second group focuses on outcomes of poor 
food utilization, i.e. nutritional failures of children under 
five years of age, such as wasting, stunting and 
underweight. Since the 2013 edition of this report, four 
more utilization indicators of micronutrient deficiency have 
been added: the prevalence of anaemia and of vitamin A 
deficiency among children under five; and the prevalence of 
iodine deficiency and of anaemia in pregnant women.3 
Data for the suite of indicators are published in FAOSTAT 
and on the FAO Food Security Indicators website.4 

Analysing the dimensions of food security 

To obtain a complete and more nuanced picture of the state 
of food security in a population, it is necessary to 
comprehensively analyse the four dimensions of food 
security. Each of them can be measured by a set of indicators 
(presented in Annex 2) that provides detailed information on 
the food security situation in a country or region. Such 
measurement and analysis inform the design of targeted 
strategies and policies to tackle food insecurity and to pave 
the way to its sustainable reduction. 

Availability of food from domestic production is key as 
economies begin to develop and domestic agriculture is still the 
main provider of food and the principal source of income and 
employment in rural areas. At this stage, increasing agricultural 
productivity improves access of subsistence food producers to 
food. However, increasing productivity may not sufficiently 
address problems of access for net food buyers and for other 
vulnerable groups who may require targeted policy interventions 
such as strengthening safety nets and other social protection.

Beyond undernourishment: insights from the suite of food security indicators 

As economies grow and diversify away from food and 
agriculture, access to food becomes increasingly important 
for achieving food security. Higher rural labour productivity 
may raise income levels, which should help improve access. 
However, remaining access difficulties for vulnerable 
population groups still need to be tackled through policy 
interventions. 

There are still many countries that have made little or no 
progress in improving food security, often because of a 
combination of adverse factors such as natural disasters, 
conflicts, price hikes, weak institutions and poor governance, 
often manifested in repeated food crises. The State of Food 
Insecurity in the World 2010 showed that protracted crises 
can create vicious circles in which recovery is fragile and may 
become more difficult over time. The price hikes on 

international food markets in 2007–08, 2010 and 2012 
highlighted how sudden price shocks can trigger severe and 
prolonged crises, underlining the importance of ensuring 
steady and reliable food supplies to safeguard the stability 
dimension of food security. 

Progress in improving availability, access and stability 
alone does not guarantee food security, as compromised 
utilization caused by poor hygiene can generate nutrition 
failures manifest in high levels of wasting and stunting, while 
inappropriate diets can give rise to obesity and diet-related 
non-communicable diseases. The coexistence of under- and 
overnutrition has taken a heavy toll on countries undergoing 
rapid transformations, resulting in the double burden of 
malnutrition. 

Empirical findings from the suite of indicators

All available data on each dimension of food security have 
been compiled and on changes in these dimensions over 
time analysed. Indicators of the four dimensions, measured 
on a scale from 1 to 5, have been aggregated into composite 
indices for each dimension for the years 1994–96 and 2012–
14 using weights derived from principal components 
analysis.5 Although all measures of micronutrient deficiencies 
could not be included because data availability is limited, the 
results of this analysis offer a more complete and nuanced 
picture of the various forms of food insecurity than any 
single indicator can achieve. They also provide better 
empirical understanding of progress towards food security. 

Many developing countries have made significant 
progress in improving food security and nutrition, but this 
progress has been uneven across both regions and 
dimensions of food security. Large challenges remain in the 
area of food utilization. Despite considerable improvements 
over the last two decades, stunting, underweight and 
micronutrient deficiencies remain stubbornly high,6 even 
where availability and access no longer pose problems. At 
the same time, access to food remains an important 
challenge for many developing countries, even if significant 
progress has been made over the last two decades, due to 
income growth and poverty reduction in many countries.

Food availability has also improved considerably over the 
past two decades, with more food available than ever 
before. This increase is reflected in the improved adequacy of 
dietary energy and higher average supplies of protein. Of the 
four dimensions, the least progress has been made in 
stability, reflecting the effects of growing political instability 

and international food price volatility. 
Overall, the analyses reveal positive trends, but it also 

masks important divergences across various subregions. The 
two subregions that have made the least headway are sub-
Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, with almost all indicators 
still pointing to low levels of food security. On the other 
hand, Eastern (including South Eastern) Asia and Latin 
America have made the most progress in improving food 
security, with Eastern Asia experiencing rapid progress on all 
four dimensions over the past two decades. 

The greatest food security challenges overall remain in 
sub-Saharan Africa, which has seen particularly slow progress 
in improving access to food, with sluggish income growth, 
high poverty rates and poor infrastructure, which hampers 
physical and distributional access. Food availability remains 
low, even though energy and protein supplies have 
improved. 

Food utilization remains a major concern, as indicated by 
the high anthropometric prevalence of stunted and 
underweight children under five years of age. Limited 
progress has been made in improving access to safe 
drinking-water and providing adequate sanitation facilities, 
while the region continues to face challenges in improving 
dietary quality and diversity, particularly for the poor. The 
stability of food supplies has deteriorated, mainly owing to 
political instability, war and civil strife. 

For Southern Asia, the main remaining challenge is the 
slow progress in improving the low levels of food utilization. 
Low utilization mainly results from poor hygienic conditions 
and inadequate sanitation facilities, with outcomes reflected

Beyond undernourishment: insights from the suite of food security indicators 

FAO has developed the Food Insecurity Experience Scale 
(FIES) as a tool to fill a gap in global food security 
monitoring, particularly for assessing the access dimension 
at the individual and household levels.1 The FIES directly 
measures the severity of food insecurity defined as the 
extent of people’s difficulties in obtaining food.2

Measuring food insecurity through experience-based 
scales is not an entirely new approach. It has been 
regularly used to assess food insecurity in United States 
households since 1995.3 Similar tools, such as the 
Household Food Insecurity Access Scale4 of Food and 
Nutrition Technical Assistance (FANTA) and FAO’s Latin 
American and Caribbean Food Security Scale,5 have 
already been adopted at national, regional and project 
levels. 

The FIES builds on the methodology used to develop 
these tools and on the experience gained from applying 
them in various country contexts. It improves on other 
tools by developing an analytic framework that ensures 
the full comparability of experience-based measures across 
countries, even in completely different food security 
situations. The FIES thus contributes to defining a truly 
global standard for measuring food insecurity at individual 
and household levels. As measurements are based on data 
collected at the individual level, the FIES enables better 
analysis of gender disparities in food insecurity.

Application of the FIES was piloted in 2013 through 
FAO’s Voices of the Hungry project in Angola, Ethiopia, 
Malawi and Niger. The results affirmed the robustness of 

the analytic method and allowed comparisons of profiles 
of the severity of food insecurity across countries.6 

With support from Belgium and the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Voices of the 
Hungry project became operational at the global level in 
2014, when the FIES questionnaire was first included in 
the Gallup World Poll,7 ensuring real-time monitoring of 
the prevalence of moderate and severe food insecurity for 
most developing countries. 

FAO is also supporting national statistical institutions in 
adopting the FIES in representative household surveys to 
monitor national food security trends, to target 
interventions, and to measure the impacts of national 
policy and programme implementation.8 Meanwhile, 
working with WFP, IFAD and other technical partners, 
further validation is being sought to ensure greater 
confidence and reliability as an indicator of food 
insecurity.

The FIES indicators will make it possible to monitor the 
prevalence of food insecurity at different levels of severity 
in a way that allows the comparison of measurements 
across countries and over time, even when the prevalence 
of severe food insecurity is low. These indicators will be a 
valuable additional component to SOFI’s suite of food 
security indicators, providing better assessment of the 
extent of problems with food access and their distribution 
within countries.

These characteristics will also make FIES measurements 
useful for countries and international organizations to

1 Reliable measures of the distribution and severity of food insecurity within a country require information at the individual level, which is not normally 
available. This lack of direct and accurate data on individuals’ food security makes it impossible to measure the prevalence of chronic caloric deficiency 
beyond the national level. Current measures refer to the average individual in the population, but do not identify who the food-insecure are or where 
they live. Actions to enhance the availability of data on food security include collecting food consumption data in large-scale national household 
surveys. However, overcoming methodological problems and establishing such surveys as the basis for regular and timely comparable assessments of 
food insecurity in the world will require time and significant additional financial and human resources. See A.D. Jones, F.M. Ngure, G. Pelto and S.L.

goal for 20309 should be to “ensure that all people, in 

particular the poor and vulnerable including infants, have 
access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year 
round”. The FIES indicators should provide the necessary 
information to respond to this monitoring need on an 
annual basis on a global scale.

in anthropometric measures. While some progress has been 
made over the last two decades, there is still much room for 
improvement. In addition, Southern Asia faces major access 
problems. While it has experienced rapid overall economic 
growth, most of the region’s poor have not participated 
adequately. Various social protection interventions have not 
been enough to ensure food access.

Northern Africa has achieved high levels of access and 
availability, reflecting rises in income levels and extensive 
policy interventions aimed at making basic food items 
available at very low prices. These interventions have 
contributed to rapid improvements in average calorie 
availability, which reached 3 425 kilocalories/person/day in 
2012–14 (up from 3 113 kilocalories/person/day in 1994–
96). However, indicators of food utilization point to 
persistent, albeit contained, problems. The prevalence of 
stunting among children remains disturbingly high, with only 
limited progress in reduction over the past two decades. 
Exacerbating this situation, the region faces a growing 
problem with overweight and obesity, as evidenced by 
supplementary indicators.

Stability remains a challenge, as signalled by low 
aggregate scores and stalled progress since the mid-1990s. 
The region is especially exposed to instability because of its 
dependency on international food markets and its rapidly 
growing population. 

Latin America as a subregion, particularly South America, 
overcame its food availability problems decades ago, with 
food production now well in excess of consumption. Latin 
America has established itself as a major agricultural 

exporter, with the agriculture sector becoming an engine of 
domestic economic and employment growth for countries in 
the region. However, such growth has not been sufficiently 
inclusive to ensure access to food for all, underscoring that 
economic growth alone is not enough to ensure sustainable 
food security and nutrition. Several countries in the region 
have successfully addressed this challenge with targeted 
social protection measures, which have significantly 
improved access. Without these measures, progress towards 
food security in the region would have been limited or 
possibly even reversed.

The few subregions to have sustained progress through 
simultaneous improvements on all four dimensions of food 
security are in Asia. Eastern and South-Eastern Asia have 
high scores on all four dimensions, initially raising agricultural 
productivity and later benefiting from rapid overall economic 
expansion. Much of the progress in fighting hunger in Asia, 
and at the global level, is accounted for by improvements in 
China and countries in South-Eastern Asia, such as 
Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam, which have experienced 
rapid economic growth over the past three decades. The 
common feature of progress in these countries is that their 
pathways to growth began with investments in agriculture, 
which resulted in higher food availability, improved access 
and steady growth in food supplies.7 The Caucasus and 
Central Asia are still exposed to stability challenges, 
stemming from either food supply swings or political 
instability. Remaining challenges across Asia as a whole are in 
the area of utilization, with problematic hygiene conditions 
and a continuing need to improve dietary quality.

Beyond undernourishment: insights from the suite of food security indicators 

•	 The suite of indicators conveys a more 
comprehensive and detailed picture of the food 
security and nutrition challenges in a country. It 
also provides valuable information for 
designing targeted food security and nutrition 
interventions. 

•	 Overall, the results confirm that developing 
countries have made significant progress in 
improving food security and nutrition, but that 
progress has been uneven across both regions 
and food security dimensions. 

•	 Food availability remains a major element of 
food insecurity in the poorer regions of the 
world, notably sub-Saharan Africa and parts of 
Southern Asia, where progress has been 
relatively limited. 

•	 Access to food has improved fast and 
significantly in countries that have experienced 
rapid overall economic progress, notably in 
Eastern and South-Eastern Asia. Access has also 
improved in Southern Asia and Latin America, 
but only in countries with adequate safety nets 
and other forms of social protection. By 
contrast, access is still a challenge in sub-
Saharan Africa, where income growth has been 
sluggish, poverty rates have remained high, 
and rural infrastructure remains limited and has 
often deteriorated.

Key findings

•	 Utilization problems remain the single largest 
challenge for developing countries, despite 
some progress over the past two decades. Most 
progress has been made in regions that already 
have relatively high levels of overall food 
security, such as Eastern Asia and Latin America.

•	 Stability remains a challenge in regions that are 
heavily reliant on international food markets for 
domestic supplies, have not ensured domestic 
food access, or are particularly vulnerable 
because of their limited and fragile natural 
resource base. These conditions are especially 
significant in the Near East and North Africa 
region and the Caribbean.

Strengthening the enabling environment 
to improve food security and nutrition: 
lessons learned from the analysis  
of individual countries

food security policies and programmes is to enhance their 
overall coordination. Such coordination requires an enabling 
environment that allows and creates incentives for key 
sectors and stakeholders to sharpen their policy focus, 
harmonize actions and improve their impact on hunger, food 
insecurity and malnutrition. An enabling environment for 
food security and nutrition should reflect commitment and 
capacities across four dimensions: policies, programmes and 
legal frameworks; mobilization of human and financial 
resources; coordination mechanisms and partnerships; and 
evidence-based decision making. Through targeted efforts 
across those dimensions, the actors and sectors concerned 
contribute to enhancing food security outcomes.8

The analysis in this section examines seven countries – 
Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, Haiti, Indonesia, 
Madagascar, Malawi and Yemen. The four dimensions of the 
enabling environment guide the country reviews. The 
discussion also considers how external events may influence 
the capacity of countries to deliver on their commitments 
and to thus progress towards achieving food security and 
nutrition objectives. 

More specifically, the analysis is based on the following 
criteria and considerations:
1. Policies, programmes and legal frameworks: The country 

implements comprehensive and evidence-based policies, 
strategies and programmes that address the immediate 
and underlying causes of food insecurity and malnutrition 
through a twin-track approach – combining immediate 
hunger relief interventions with long-term actions for 
sustainable growth, especially in agriculture and the rural 
economy. Policies should be supported by appropriate 
legal frameworks which promote people’s right to food. 

2. Human and financial resources: Policies, strategies, 
programmes and legislation are translated into effective 
action through the allocation of financial and human 
resources and the effective administrative capacity of 

W orld leaders have made several commitments to drastically reduce or eliminate hunger and malnutrition and achieve sustainable food 
security for all. Progress continues, but at least 805 million 
people in the world still suffer from chronic hunger. Decades 
of food security policies and programmes have brought the 
MDG 1c hunger target – of halving the hungry share of the 
population – within reach, but more efforts are needed to 
achieve internationally agreed goals. The first section of this 
issue of The State of Food Insecurity in the World shows 
clearly that progress in hunger reduction is uneven among 
regions and countries, implying that the global picture masks 
lack of sufficient progress in many countries, especially where 
food insecurity is high. 

A key lesson learned from examining country experiences 
is that hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition are complex 
problems that cannot be solved by a single stakeholder or 
sector. A variety of actions are required to deal with the 
immediate and underlying causes of hunger and 
malnutrition. Depending on the context and the specific 
situation, actions may be required in agricultural production 
and productivity, rural development, fisheries, forestry, social 
protection, public works, trade and markets, resilience to 
shocks, education and health, and other areas. While many 
of these actions will be at the national and local levels, some 
issues are regional or global in scope and require action at 
the appropriate level. Policies and programmes are 
formulated and implemented in complex social, political and 
economic environments, and there is growing recognition 
that food security governance is crucial for their success. 

Acknowledging that concerned stakeholders are driven by 
their own interests, which tend to be “compartmentalized”, 
if not competing – as seen, for example, in the divergent 
goals of different stakeholders, or the separate actions taken 
by governments, civil society and the private sector – a 
fundamental challenge for improving the effectiveness of

Strengthening the enabling environment to improve food security and nutrition

In July 2014, at the African Union summit in Malabo, 
Equatorial Guinea, African Heads of State1 committed to 
end hunger in the continent by 2025. At the 2013 
summit of the Community of Latin America and the 
Caribbean States (CELAC),2 Heads of State and 
Government endorsed the Hunger-Free Latin America 
and the Caribbean Initiative to end hunger by 2025, an 
initiative launched in 2005. Together, these two regional 
organizations include nearly 90 states and over 
1.5 billion people. These commitments send a powerful 
message to their citizens and to the rest of the world. 

The Latin America and Caribbean regional 
commitment to end hunger by 2025 is underpinned by 
national and regional actions to promote food security 
that have contributed to progress in the region as a 
whole, towards both the MDG hunger target and the 
WFS goal. The decision has built on and, in turn, 
strengthened the commitment and participation of 
various actors involved – governments, parliaments, and 
non-state actors. It has reinforced integrated approaches 
to promote food security adopted in many countries of 
the regions, e.g. by linking social protection with 
support to enhance production. Regional commitment 
and cooperation encourage the sharing of experiences 
and other cooperation among developing countries. 
Africa’s commitment to end hunger by 2025 also 
promises to strengthen on-going efforts within the 
framework of NEPAD’s Comprehensive Africa Agriculture 
Development Programme (CAADP). The Africa Solidarity 
Trust Fund for Food Security, established in 2013, is also 
a manifestation of the willingness of the region to create 
the appropriate instruments to move forward the 
hunger eradication agenda. 

Governments in various regions have also responded 
to the call made by United Nations Secretary-General 
Ban Ki-moon in his Zero Hunger Challenge: to build a 
future in which all people enjoy their fundamental right 
to food, and in which their livelihoods and food systems 
are resilient and able to withstand the pressures induced 
by climate change and other resource and environmental 
challenges. Eradicating hunger will make a major 

contribution to poverty reduction and to global peace 
and stability. 

In general, turning political commitment into results 
on the ground implies, inter alia, the adoption of a 
comprehensive large-scale approach to prioritizing and 
investing in agriculture, rural development, education, 
health, decent work, social protection and equality of 
opportunity. It also requires policies and programmes to 
improve the productivity of family farmers, especially 
women and youth. Investing in sustainable family 
farming is crucial: family farmers produce a high 
proportion of the food we eat and are, by far, the 
biggest source of employment in the world. They are 
also the custodians of the world’s agricultural 
biodiversity and other natural resources. Such policies 
and programmes should address the need for better 
infrastructure, including to better link farmers to markets 
and to reducing food losses, especially post-harvest. At 
the same time, actions are required to raise incomes and 
to bring about more equitable and sustainable rural 
development.

Integrated actions are key to fight hunger. 
Interventions to boost agricultural productivity growth 
are most effective in promoting food security when 
complemented by social protection measures. For 
example, school meal programmes can be designed to 
procure food from smallholder farmer organizations 
and cooperatives. This, in turn, raises producer incomes 
while stimulating the local supply of more nutritious, 
diverse and safe foods by small family farmers. Cash 
transfer programmes are an important tool for social 
protection and poverty reduction strategies. While their 
focus is on food security, health, nutrition and 
education, particularly of children, they can also 
enhance the productive capacities of beneficiary 
households who typically have few assets and limited 
access to financial services. The provision of predictable 
regular cash transfers to poor households can both 
promote investment and mitigate risk, thus stimulating 
production and productivity increases, both on- and 
off-farm.

The world can end hunger by 2025

government. Resource constraints compromise the quality 
of policy design, implementation and effectiveness. 

3. Coordination mechanisms and partnerships: Governments 
should regard food security and nutrition as an 
intersectoral priority by setting up high-level institutional 
mechanisms responsible for the design, implementation 
and coordination of food security and nutrition policies. 
The government takes a lead role in managing 
partnerships and coordinated actions among a broad 
range of actors and sectors involved in food security and 
nutrition at the national and decentralized levels, including 
by creating space for civil society participation. A major 
challenge for effective coordination is ensuring that 
planned actions are compatible with the stakeholders’ 
other incentives. 

4. Evidenced-based decision-making: Decision-making on 
food security and nutrition draws on evidence generated 
from functional information systems that monitor trends, 
track and map actions, and assess impacts in a timely and 
comprehensive manner, enabling lessons learned to be fed 
back into the policy process.
The countries examined in this section have very different 

food security situations, policy environments and governance 
regimes (in terms of partnerships and coordination 
mechanisms), all conditioned by prevailing levels of political 
stability, conflict, cultural identities, social and environmental 
conditions, economic growth and stages of development. 

However, all the countries seek to address food insecurity 
through the twin-track approach of enhancing agricultural 
productivity and promoting rural development while 
facilitating access to adequate food for people in need. 

The Plurinational State of Bolivia has established processes 
and institutions that include all stakeholders, particularly 
previously marginalized indigenous peoples, ensuring 
adequate food security for those in need. In Brazil, efforts 
that started in 2003 have resulted in successful participatory 
processes and coordinating institutions, delivering policies 
that have effectively reduced poverty and hunger. 

In Madagascar, political crisis has hindered the 
development of food security institutions, but the situation is 
now back to normal, with the Government working on 
rebuilding capacities.

In Yemen, following the recent political unrest, the 
transition government has taken steps to improve food 
security and nutrition. Indonesia has made significant 
progress in establishing an enabling environment through 
efforts that include strengthening local government 
capacities. 

Haiti, a country in protracted crisis frequently hit by natural 
disasters, has also taken steps to improve the design and 
implementation of food security policies to cope with multiple 
challenges. In Malawi, progress in fighting hunger stands out 
against its modest, but improving, food security 
arrangements.

Plurinational State of Bolivia

Bolivia has developed a political environment that is 
conducive to indigenous peoples and smallholder producers’ 
organizations, making it – together with Ecuador – an 
exceptional case in South America. Significant reductions in 
food insecurity have occurred alongside two decades of 
efforts to empower indigenous people, who comprise about 
62 percent of the population. 

Between 2001 and 2012, extreme poverty decreased by 
17.2 percent because of income redistribution, with the 
average income of the poorest 40 percent of the population 
growing by three times as much as the average national 
income. These reductions in poverty are reflected in 
reductions in the prevalence of undernourishment. The 
proportion of undernourished people in the population 
decreased from 38 percent in 1990–92 to 19.5 percent in 
2012–14 (Figure 5). A strong focus on pro-poor and food 
security policies resulted in the prevalence of 
undernourishment decreasing by 7.4 percentage points 
between 2009–11 and 2012–14, while chronic 

undernourishment in children under three years of age fell to 
18.5 percent in 2012 (Figure 6). Malnutrition is also 
decreasing: between 1994 and 2008, the prevalence of 
stunting among children under five years of age declined 
from 35.2 percent to 27.2 percent. Ending hunger is a goal 
in the country’s wider development plans such as the 
Patriotic Agenda 2025, the development goals of which 
include eradicating extreme poverty and hunger in line with 
international food security and nutrition targets. 

Agriculture plays a crucial role in the Bolivian food security 
strategy – about a third of the population lives in rural areas 
where poverty is widespread. In implementing a twin-track 
approach, the government places equal weight on increasing 
the productivity of family farmers and addressing the 
immediate needs of vulnerable people through social 
protection and cash transfer programmes. As well as 
facilitating access to food, these programmes have a positive 
impact on other dimensions of food security. The provision 
of regular and predictable cash transfers leads to increased

Strengthening the enabling environment to improve food security and nutrition

on-farm investments and improves the productive capacity 
of beneficiary households. Social protection programmes 
promote nutrition education, improve food utilization and 
build resilience to natural disasters. Addressing social justice 
concerns and targeting the most vulnerable segments of the 
population with measures that improve food access and 
utilization reflect a deeper transformation in the design of 
food security policies in the Plurinational State of Bolivia. 
Since 2006, legal provisions (Law 3545) have significantly 
increased access to land for indigenous communities and 
smallholder farmers, offering tenure security to previously 
marginalized people. Legal frameworks related to food 
security have been strengthened to provide formal 
recognition and support to the economic, civil and political 
participation of smallholders and indigenous groups. 

In 2007, the Bolivian Government instituted the 
National Development Plan, which set food security as a 
cornerstone of national sovereignty. The Plan also defined 
policy guidelines for promoting food security and 
sovereignty by ensuring the provision of healthy, 
domestically produced food and deepening the contribution 
of agriculture and forestry to improve livelihoods.9

However, the main milestone has been the adoption of 
the new Constitution in 2009, which proclaims political, 
economic, legal, cultural and linguistic pluralism. The 
Constitution empowers the indigenous majority and 
protects a range of human rights, including the right to 
food.10    
In 2009, the country took a major step towards realization 
of the right to food by including this right in its 
Constitution. Legislation on communal agricultural 
production11 recognizes the role of indigenous farmers in 
food production, and indigenous communities as economic 
organizations of smallholders.12 Relevant laws include 

provisions to facilitate the establishment of an enabling 
environment for food security and nutrition. Legislation 
defines how institutions interact in the development of 
policies to support agricultural production, trade and 
finance, and defines mechanisms that enable all stakeholders 
to participate in formulating policies, thus prioritizing 
community-level needs.13 Other essential elements of food 
security governance in the Plurinational State of Bolivia 
include building institutions’ capacities to implement policies 
effectively, and providing a legal framework for the 
sustainable management of natural resources. 

In 2012, the Government approved the Framework Law 
of the Mother Earth and Integral Development to Live Well 
(Ley Marco de la Madre Tierra y Desarrollo Integral para Vivir 
Bien), which establishes the basis for sustainable 
development, promoting the conservation and the 
regeneration of the environment, and recovering and 
strengthening local and traditional knowledge. The 
framework law covers different areas, including food 
production and consumption.

The country’s architecture for food security governance 
(Figure 7) facilitates improved food security and nutrition 
through a mix of policies and programmes with the dual 
objective of creating opportunities for the hungry to improve 
their livelihoods by promoting agricultural and rural 
development, and ensuring direct and immediate action 
against hunger through programmes that enhance access to 
food. 

Several state-owned enterprises aim to increase food 
productivity. For example, the Food Production Support

Company assists small and medium-sized producers of food 
staples such as wheat, soybean, rice and maize by providing 
credit, intermediation in input procurement and sales of 
produce, and access to machinery. Other state-owned 
enterprises provide agricultural inputs such as certified seeds 
and fertilizers. LACTEBOSOL promotes the production and 
marketing of dairy products.14 

The Pachamama agricultural insurance programme aims 
to reduce farmers’ vulnerability to natural shocks and to 
reduce migration from rural areas to the cities.15 The many 
programmes focusing on small family farmers include the 
Creation of Rural Agrifood Initiatives programme, which 
promotes small-scale food production, and the Rural 
Alliances programme, which aims to improve access to credit 
for smallholder farmers.

Interventions that seek to improve child nutrition include 
school meal programmes implemented by local governments 
and covering 89 percent of the children attending school.16 
Conditional cash transfers to vulnerable groups – including 
the Dignity Pension, which reaches about 1 million elderly 
people, Bono Juancito Pinto, which helps nearly 2 million 
poor families with children under five years of age and aims 
to increase school attendance, and Bono Juana Azurduy, 
which provides cash to pregnant and lactating women with 
no medical insurance – also reduce poverty and enhance 
food security and nutrition. The Bono programmes reach 
those in need, even in the most isolated municipalities.17

Food security and nutrition policies are highly inclusive, 
with local communities – including indigenous ones – 
participating in their formulation and implementation. 
Institutional platforms that facilitate the discussion and 
coordination of food security and nutrition policies include 
the Plurinational Economic and Productive Board, which 
coordinates the design of food security policies, identifies 
participating actors, and is responsible for monitoring and 
evaluation of policies. 

The National Food Security and Nutrition Board (CONAN) 
is responsible for implementing and coordinating 

programmes and policies, bringing together several 
ministries and departments, including the Office of the 
President.18 Departmental and municipal food and nutrition 
boards carry out CONAN’s functions at the subnational and 
local community levels. Food security policies are discussed in 
the Parliamentary Group Against Hunger, whose members 
include representatives of academia, civil society and 
implementing institutions. However, the most important 
element in the governance structure for food security is the 
Patriotic Agenda, the country’s core development plan, 
which brings together ministries at different administrative 
levels and civil society to fight undernourishment.

These governance mechanisms are informed by an 
extensive system of data collection. The National Statistics 
Office collects information through household and 
employment surveys and monitors food prices, albeit not 
consistently. The Ministry of Health manages the National 
Health Information System, which collects anthropometric 
information on children and on women of reproductive age. 
The Ministry of Rural Development and Land maintains the 
Production and Agro-environmental Observatory, which 
collects information on food production. 

The Plurinational State of Bolivia has made significant 
progress in food security and its governance. Legal 
frameworks such as Law 144 embed food security and food 
sovereignty issues in the Constitution, and recognize 
indigenous people as producers of food and formal 
recipients of public resources. Significant advances in 
developing food security governance are reflected in the 
system’s participatory processes and policy coordination. 
However, the development of strong and effective 
institutions at the local level – involving different 
stakeholders in addressing multiple food security objectives 
and implementing policies – remains a major challenge. 
Political commitment is crucial, and the Government of the 
Plurinational State of Bolivia has ensured that food security 
and sovereignty remain a priority in the Patriotic Agenda of 
2025, the country’s long-term development plan.

This edition of The State of Food Insecurity in the World 
reveals that Brazil achieved both the MDG target of halving 
the proportion of its people who suffer from hunger and the 
more stringent WFS target of reducing by half the absolute 
number of hungry people. This achievement is consistent 
with the overall improvement in human development and 
reduction in inequality that the country experienced in recent 
years.19 Progress towards these internationally established 
targets was accelerated when ending hunger was put at the 
centre of Brazil’s political agenda. Ensuring that all people 
could eat three meals a day – as former President Luis 
Ignácio Lula da Silva said in his inaugural address – became a 
presidential and government priority in 2003, with the 
launch of the Zero Hunger programme. Between 2000–02 
and 2004–06, the undernourishment rate in Brazil fell by 
half from 10.7 percent to below 5 percent.

Zero Hunger was the first step in translating the decision 
to end hunger into action, and introduced a new approach 
for the country that placed food security and nutrition and 
social inclusion at the centre of the government’s agenda, 
while linking macroeconomic, social and agricultural policies. 
Over the years, this approach gained momentum through 
strengthening of the legal framework for food security and 
nutrition; establishment of an institutional setting that 
facilitates cooperation and coordination among ministries 
and different levels of government, with clearly defined 
responsibilities; increased investments in areas such as family 
farming and social protection; and strong involvement of civil 
society in the policy process, from formulation to monitoring 
and from the national to the local level, through the National 
Food and Nutrition Security Council (CONSEA). The 
successful reduction of hunger and extreme poverty in both 
rural and urban areas resulted from this well-coordinated 
array of policies led by the government with strong 
engagement from civil society, rather than from any single, 
isolated action. 

The inclusive development model has since been 
incorporated into the Brazil without Extreme Poverty plan, 
launched in 2011 by President Dilma Rousseff with the bold 
goal of eliminating extreme poverty in Brazil. What began as 
a government pledge to end hunger was transformed, over 
a decade, into national law with institutional structures 
aimed at promoting the progressive realization of the human 
right to adequate food, which was enshrined in the country’s 
Constitution in 2010.

The Zero Hunger programme comprised an integrated 
set of actions across 19 ministries, and applied a twin-track 
approach linking social protection to policies for promoting 
income equality, employment, family farm production, and 
nutrition. Economic policies and social protection 

programmes, such as the ambitious Family Allowance cash 
transfer programme, combined with innovative 
programmes for family farming created links between 
productive support and social protection, contributing to 
job creation and higher real wages,20 as well as significant 
decreases in hunger and greater income equality. FAO 
provided support through international technical 
cooperation agreements, and played an important role in 
preparing the Zero Hunger programme for implementation 
in the first months of 2003.

The results of these efforts are demonstrated by Brazil’s 
success in meeting internationally established goals. Overall 
poverty fell from 24.3 percent to 8.4 percent of the 
population between 2001 and 2012,21 while extreme poverty 
dropped from 14.0 percent to 3.5 percent.22 From 2001 to 
2012, the income of the poorest 20 percent of the 
population grew by three times as much as that of the 
wealthiest 20 percent (Figure 8).23 The proportion of 
undernourished people fell from 10.7 percent of the 
population in 2000–02 to less than 5 percent in 2004–06.

The prevalence of stunting in children under five years of 
age was nearly halved from 13.4 percent in 1996 to 
6.7 percent in 2006, while child wasting fell from 
4.2 percent to 1.8 percent (Figure 9).24 A national survey that 
included the Brazilian Household Food Insecurity Scale 
showed a 25 percent decrease in severe food insecurity from 
2004 to 2009. The decrease in food insecurity was greater 
among people living in extreme poverty.25

Strengthening the enabling environment to improve food security and nutrition

Brazil’s National Food and Nutrition Security Law (Law 
No. 11.346 of September 2006) defines food and nutrition 
security as “the realization of everyone’s right to regular and 
permanent access to enough food of good quality without 
compromising access to other basic necessities, and based 
on food practices that promote health, respect cultural 
diversity, and are environmentally, culturally, economically, 
and socially sustainable”. The breadth of this definition was 
reflected in the Zero Hunger programme and subsequent 
policies and programmes, which include activities ranging 
from sustainable agricultural practices to education in 
nutrition and food habits – the approach that shaped today’s 
National Food and Nutrition Security Plan.

The current National Food and Nutrition Security Plan 
incorporates more than 40 programmes and actions. While 
the Ministry of Social Development and Fight against Hunger 
is responsible for many of these programmes, several core 
actions pertain to other ministries, including those of Health, 
Agrarian Development, Education, Agriculture and 
Environment.

Federal expenditures on food security and nutrition 
programmes and actions totalled approximately 
US$35 billion in 2013. Spending on social programmes 
increased by more than 128 percent from 2000 to 2012, 
while the share of these programmes in gross national 
product increased by 31 percent.26 In 2013, social protection 
programmes accounted for the largest portion of Federal 
allocations to food security and nutrition, while programmes 
related to food production and distribution, including those 
to promote family farming, accounted for one-sixth.27 

The Family Allowance income transfer programme, 
launched in 2003 as part of Zero Hunger, currently provides 

cash benefits, preferentially in the mother’s name, to more 
than 13.8 million low-income families on the condition that 
children in the family remain in school and visit the local 
health clinic monthly for growth monitoring and 
immunization. Investment in this programme tripled in ten 
years, reaching nearly US$11 billion in 2013, and currently 
accounts for approximately one-third of Federal expenditures 
on food security and nutrition programmes and actions.28 

The Brazil without Extreme Poverty strategy builds on the 
success of Zero Hunger. In 2011, it introduced new policies 
targeting the extremely poor, which included improving 
access to public services to promote education, health and 
employment. To ensure that children receive the care and 
nutrition they need during their first 1 000 days, policies 
supporting families with young children have been 
implemented. Measures include increasing the Family 
Allowance cash distributions for children and pregnant and 
lactating women, and expanding access to day care and 
preschools – all of which improve access to nutritious food. 
In March 2013, families in extreme poverty started to receive 
benefits that ensure a minimum per capita income of 
approximately US$1.25 per day. An additional 22.1 million 
Brazilians have been lifted out of extreme poverty since 
2011.29

Another pillar of food security and nutrition policy in 
Brazil is the National School Meals Programme, which 
provides free meals to all public school pupils – a total of 
more than 43 million children in 2012. Public schools in 
Brazil serve children mainly from lower-income families, and 
the improved access to food provided by the programme 
represents a substantial benefit for poorer households. 
Federal investment in the school meals programme was 
US$1.5 billion in 2012, complemented by funding from state 
and municipal governments.30 The programme’s impact has 
been significant enough to reduce the estimated prevalence 
of undernourishment in Brazil by about one-third compared 
with what it would likely have been without the 
programme.31

Policies for strengthening family farming were central to 
the Zero Hunger programme from the outset. Implementation 
of these policies in parallel with cash transfer programmes 
such as the Family Allowance illustrated the twin-track 
approach of actions to eliminate hunger. While agribusinesses 
and large-scale farms dominate export-oriented agricultural 
production in Brazil, family farming is growing and currently 
accounts for 70 percent of the food consumed in the 
country.32 Investments in policies to support family farmers 
totalled US$5.6 billion in 2013;33 the budget of the rural credit 
programme of the National Programme for Strengthening 
Family Farming had increased tenfold since 2003. 

Other policies, such as the provision of crop insurance 
against food price risks and extreme climatic events, minimum 
price guarantees, specific support to women, rural development 
and technical assistance, all aim to increase productivity and 
incomes while also responding to specific needs in different

regions of Brazil. Over the last ten years, access to land has 
been enhanced by allocating 50 million hectares to more than 
600 000 poor landless families. Brazil without Extreme Poverty 
programmes strengthen this support by providing family 
farmers with extension services for implementing three-year 
resilience projects and improving their livelihoods. Programmes 
in semi-arid regions ensure that poor rural families have access 
to water, to increase their productivity through irrigation and to 
improve sanitation.

The innovative Family Farming Food Procurement 
Programme, launched in 2003 as part of Zero Hunger, 
purchases food directly from family farmers and donates it to 
institutions serving vulnerable populations, or uses it to 
replenish government stocks. By guaranteeing a market for 
small family farmers, the programme contributes to poverty 
alleviation in rural areas – nearly half of participating farmers 
are poor.34 In 2012, more than 185 000 farmers throughout 
Brazil participated in the programme, each receiving an 
average of approximately US$2 000 for their products.35 
Federal allocations to the programme increased nearly 
tenfold since 2003, to exceed US$600 million in 2013. Such 
linkages between social protection policies and measures to 
support family farmers characterize the policy mix in Brazil. In 
2009, the National School Meals Programme adopted a 
policy of requiring public schools to allocate at least 
30 percent of food expenditures to direct purchases from 
family farmers. By 2012, 80 percent of public schools were 
purchasing directly from family farmers, and half had 
achieved the 30 percent goal.36 

These investments in family farming have had a significant 
impact. Over the last ten years, family farmers’ income has 
increased by 52 percent in real terms, and more than 
3.7 million people in rural areas have entered the middle class. 

The governance of food security and nutrition has also 
evolved significantly over the past decade. A series of legal 
milestones, consolidation of institutional arrangements by 
the Federal Government, and effective promotion of the 
participation of diverse stakeholders facilitate actions to 
support food security and nutrition policy.37 Central to these 
efforts is the National Food and Nutrition Security Council 
(CONSEA), which was originally created in 1993, 
discontinued in 1995 and reinstated in 2003 as an advisory 
council with a direct institutional link to the Office of the 
President. Two-thirds of CONSEA’s members are 
representatives of civil society and one-third come from the 
government. In 2006, it worked with the Federal 
Government to ensure passage of the National Food and 
Nutrition Security Law, which instituted the National Food 
and Nutrition Security System (SISAN).

SISAN is central to food security governance in Brazil. It is 
composed of two bodies at the national level: CONSEA; and 
the Interministerial Chamber on Food and Nutrition Security 
(CAISAN), which is composed of government representatives 
responsible for food security and nutrition policies and 
programmes. CONSEA guides and monitors food security 

and nutrition policies, including the National Food and 
Nutrition Security Plan, and promotes the integration of food 
and nutrition activities into a unified strategy, while CAISAN 
is the interministerial mechanism for government 
coordination, implementation and management of the 
National Food and Nutrition Security Plan. This institutional 
architecture at the Federal level is replicated at the state and 
municipal levels. 

In 2010, the human right to adequate food was 
incorporated into the Brazilian Constitution and the National 
Food and Nutrition Security Plan was instituted by decree. 
These developments consolidated the advances that Brazil 
had made and ensured the sustainability of policies initiated 
under Zero Hunger. CONSEA played a major role in these 
achievements, including by mobilizing public opinion 
throughout the country. 

Established in 2003, the National Council for Sustainable 
Rural Development provides the institutional setting for 
coordinating rural development and family farming 
programmes in a role similar to that of CONSEA for food 
security and nutrition. The National Sustainable Rural 
Development and Family Farming Plan consists of dozens of 
coordinated policies and programmes that are linked to 
actions promoted by the National Food and Nutrition 
Security Plan.

Currently, the government is working to consolidate 
SISAN at the municipal level, as most Federal programmes 
for food security and nutrition and family farming are 
managed at this level according to national directives, 
following a decentralized approach that is already in place in 
other sectors. For example, beneficiaries of the Family 
Allowance programme are identified locally through a 
unified national registry of social programmes that facilitates 
the targeting and coordination of programmes and benefits. 
Municipal governments also monitor families’ compliance 
with the conditions for the Family Allowance programme 
and link beneficiaries to employment training and other 
social programmes through the Universal Social Assistance 
System. Family farmers’ participation in the food 
procurement programme is also managed locally, with 
targeting aided by a national registry of family farmers that 
serves as the gateway to an array of programmes for 
supporting family farmers. The participation of civil society 
organizations is crucial in these efforts, as they play a core 
role in setting up and maintaining the registries, and 
ensuring that families entitled to receive benefits are 
included.

Monitoring of food security and nutrition has been an 
integral part of the strategy to fight hunger since 2004, 
effectively guiding decisions and documenting progress. The 
Federal Government has worked closely with CONSEA to 
implement a national food security and nutrition information 
system with more than 50 indicators divided among six 
dimensions of food security: (i) food production; (ii) food 
availability; (iii) income and living conditions; (iv) access to

Strengthening the enabling environment to improve food security and nutrition

adequate food and water; (v) health, nutrition and access to 
related services; and (vi) education. Policy evaluation, 
conducted by an evaluation unit in the Ministry of Social 
Development, also has a significant impact by informing 
programme management, gaining support for successful 
measures and guiding policy-makers.38

Brazil has made great strides in food security and nutrition 
governance over the last ten years, with laws and institutions 
that are the legacy of the Zero Hunger programme. 
Significant advances in poverty and hunger alleviation 
demonstrate the success of this intersectoral, participatory 
and well-coordinated approach. The National Food and 
Nutrition Security Plan, developed with the effective 
participation of diverse stakeholders, is linked to the Federal 
budget and a well-structured system for monitoring food 

and nutrition security. The ambitious Brazil without Extreme 
Poverty strategy builds on all of these strengths in scaling up 
actions to reach vulnerable populations and invest in early 
childhood – priority actions that hold promise for the future.

Collaboration among ministries and sectors is a continual 
challenge, but CONSEA and CAISAN are fulfilling their roles 
as coordinating mechanisms. Joint interministerial strategies 
are increasingly common, based on growing intersectoral 
vision and capacity.

The structures and capacities resulting from the evolution 
and institutionalization of food security and nutrition 
governance, and continuing financial and political 
commitment, place Brazil on a solid footing to protect the 
advances achieved and to face the new challenges that lie 
ahead.

Haiti has one of the highest levels of food insecurity in the 
world; more than half of its total population is chronically 
undernourished (Figure 10). Although this represents a 
decrease in the prevalence of undernourishment, from 
61.1 percent at the beginning of the 1990s, the number of 
hungry people has increased from 4.4 million in 1990–92 to 
5.3 million in 2012–14 because population growth has not 
been matched by sufficient levels of development.

Poor nutrition status among children is another reflection 
of the severity of food insecurity in Haiti. In 2012, 
11.4 percent of children under five years of age were 
underweight, and 21.9 percent were stunted. However, 
although these levels are still alarmingly high, they show 
some progress towards achievement of the MDG hunger 
target; in 1990, the rate of underweight was 23.7 percent 
and that of stunting 40.1 percent. 

Food insecurity in Haiti is related to high levels of extreme 
poverty. In 2001, 62 percent of the population lived on less 
than $1.25/day (international dollars). With low rates of 
economic growth, averaging about 0.8 percent per year 
between 2000 and 2012, poverty persists, and the latest 
estimates suggest that 40 percent of the population lived 
below the even more severe poverty line of US$1/day in 
2011.39 Recurring natural disasters exacerbate the fragility of 
the economy. The government reports that in 2012, the 
number of people suffering from acute food insecurity40 
increased from 800 000 to more than 1.5 million – about 
15 percent of the total population – as a result of drought, 
tropical storms and hurricane Sandy.41 Natural disasters 
deepen unemployment as people lose their livelihoods in the 
devastated economy, and access to food worsens. 

Even before the earthquake of 2010, unemployment 
exceeded 16 percent, with higher rates among young people 
(30 percent) and in urban areas (33 percent in the 
metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince). Agriculture provides 
50 percent of jobs at the national level and accounts for 
25 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). 
For most of the 1 million small farmers, low agricultural 
productivity and tenure insecurity are significant problems. 
Farms are small – averaging less than 1 hectare each – and 
increasing population density puts pressure on farm size,

Strengthening the enabling environment to improve food security and nutrition

which is exacerbated by urban encroachment on arable and 
irrigated land. 

Haiti depends on food imports to satisfy demand; this 
dependence is increasing as the population continues to grow 
while agricultural productivity remains low. Food imports 
represented 44 percent of total food availability in 2010, 
compared with 19 percent three decades ago. Although self 
sufficient in rice during the 1980s, Haiti became a major rice 
importer, a shift brought about by the country’s changes in 
trade policies, extreme poverty and vulnerability to extreme 
weather events. About 80 percent of rice and 100 percent of 
wheat – staples that account for one-third of the calorie 
intake of the population – are sourced from international 
markets.42 In 2008–10, Haiti spent 50 percent more on food 
imports than it received from total merchandise exports. Such 
exposure to international markets makes the country 
vulnerable to international price shocks. 

The devastation caused by the earthquake in 2010 
prompted the government and its international partners to 
develop plans that focus on both reconstruction and long-
term economic development. Haiti’s Strategic Development 
Plan concentrates on rebuilding the country’s economic, 
social and institutional structures, and aims to transform 
Haiti into an emerging economy by 2030.43

Food security policies and related institutional 
arrangements are embedded in the Strategic Development 
Plan. The National Plan for Food Security, developed for the 
first time in 1996 and revised in 2010 by the National 
Coordination Agency for Food Security (CNSA), reflects this 
longer-term vision. Its objectives are to eradicate hunger by 

2025 and to guarantee the right to food by establishing 
measures that address the multiple dimensions of food 
security. The plan emphasizes agriculture and productivity 
growth to increase the availability of food while generating 
employment and income in the rural areas where poverty 
and food insecurity are most severe. The role of agriculture in 
achieving food security is reflected in the Agricultural 
Development Policy 2010–2025, which aims to create the 
conditions for promoting agricultural productivity, ensuring 
food security, increasing value-added and enhancing 
resilience to natural catastrophes.

The Three-Year Agricultural Recovery Programme aims to 
initiate agricultural development across the country through 
an array of policies and measures. For example, the Support 
to Family Agriculture sub-programme targets small family 
farmers with interventions to improve their access to inputs 
and services that increase productivity and incomes. Its 
broader objective is to increase the country’s food self-
sufficiency from 50 to 60 percent. The Agribusiness Recovery 
sub-programme aims to strengthen the capacity of 
agribusinesses through better value chain coordination, 
logistics, marketing and processing, and to increase the value 
of agricultural exports by 40 percent from their 2009–2011 
levels. The Three-Year Agricultural Recovery Programme also 
includes measures to promote the sustainable management 
of natural resources, and – even more important – its 
Institutional and Governance Strengthening sub-programme 
aims to reform and build the capacities of the Ministry of 
Agriculture in monitoring, evaluating and managing policy 
processes for agricultural development.

Strengthening the enabling environment to improve food security and nutrition

While interventions in agriculture are geared to improving 
productivity and food availability, the National Programme 
for the Fight against Hunger and Malnutrition, Aba Grangou, 
focuses on increasing food access and utilization. An 
initiative of the President of Haiti, launched in 2012, Aba 
Grangou aims to half the prevalence of hunger and 
malnutrition between 2012 and 2016, and to eradicate them 
by 2025. Aba Grangou follows the general principles of the 
National Plan for Food Security and shifts the overall strategy 
for food security towards a twin-track approach, combining 
attention to the most urgent food needs with solutions to 
address long-term challenges to food security.

Aba Grangou provides an umbrella for 21 programmes, 
ranging from cash transfers and school meals to investments 
in agricultural infrastructure and basic public services. For 
example, it aims to improve access to food for 2.2 million 
children by scaling up the National School Meals Programme, 
which currently provides hot meals to 1.5 million children 
every day. Aba Grangou also promotes food purchases from 
local small farmers to supply the schools, thus providing the 
farmers with a market for their produce. Other measures are 
designed to facilitate food access during emergencies, such 
as temporary employment programmes, cash transfers or 
food voucher programmes. The National Network of 
Multipurpose Development Agents coordinates the activities 
of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) under Aba 
Grangou, and helps to ensure that the most vulnerable 
households have access to nutritious diets and information.

Access to food has also been improved by Haiti’s social 
protection policies. The National Social Assistance 
Programme provides extremely poor households with cash 
transfers and other subsidies. For example, Ti Manman Cheri 
is a conditional cash transfer programme aimed at enhancing 

children’s school attendance. Other social protection 
measures, such as the Solidarity Cart, mobile and fixed 
canteens and emergency vouchers, are designed to facilitate 
food access during emergency situations through in-kind and 
cash transfers. 

The government’s commitment to fighting hunger is 
reflected not only in this broad range of policies and 
programmes, but also by an increase in budget allocations. 
Public spending on food security and poverty reduction 
increased from just over 40 percent of total public 
expenditure in 2007–09 to 59 percent in 2012–13.

Efforts to achieve multiple objectives – such as promoting 
agricultural productivity growth, creating jobs, improving 
food security and nutrition, and supporting the sustainable 
management of natural resources while enhancing 
communities’ resilience to natural disasters – require strong 
institutions and sound governance mechanisms. After the 
earthquake of 2010, the Government of Haiti established 
institutional arrangements that identify the mechanisms, 
actors and responsibilities involved in a wide range of 
policies. 

The National Coordination Agency for Food Security 
(CNSA) was established in 1996 to formulate and coordinate 
food security policies and programmes under the direction of 
the Ministry of Agriculture; it is composed of officials from 
the Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Planning and External 
Cooperation, Economy and Finance, and Trade. In 2010, 
CNSA developed the National Plan for Food Security. As well 
as policy formulation and coordination, CNSA is also 
responsible for overseeing the use of foreign aid for food 
security activities; developing a food security monitoring 
system; and providing a framework of action for responding 
to food crises. For example, CNSA regularly collects and

disseminates information on the state of food security, and 
monitors food price trends at the national and local levels, 
enabling it to issue food crisis alerts when necessary. 

The establishment of Aba Grangou significantly enhanced 
food security governance in Haiti. Aba Grangou promotes 
the participation of local governments and civil society by 
strengthening the institutional capacity of municipalities and 
mechanisms for involving civil society, such as the Support to 
Participatory Development Councils that already function in 
73 municipalities.

Aba Grangou is an ambitious programme for which 
responsibility is divided among several government 
departments, including the President’s Office, nine ministries, 
autonomous public departments and Haiti’s Red Cross Society. 
Its multiple and interrelated objectives require significant 
collaboration across the government. The National 
Commission for the Fight against Hunger and Malnutrition – 
composed of members from the Office of the President, the 
Office of the Prime Minister, ministries and Parliament, and 
chaired by the First Lady – has the task of providing overall 
guidance and political support to Aba Grangou. The Planning 
Committee for the Fight against Hunger and Malnutrition also 
involves nine ministries and is responsible for planning 
programme measures and prioritizing and allocating 
resources. At the operational level, the National Coordination 
Agency for the Management of Aba Grangou, under the 
direction of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, is in charge 

of the programme’s overall coordination, results-based 
management, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting. 

Rapid progress towards food security in Haiti depends heavily 
on having coherent policies, while the presence of multiple 
coordination mechanisms poses challenges. At the 
implementation level, increased coordination among the Ministry 
of Agriculture, which is responsible for agricultural development 
policy, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which coordinates 
social protection policies, and the other ministries participating in 
Aba Grangou is essential for strengthening food security 
governance. Bringing together mechanisms such as CNSA and 
the National Commission for the Fight against Hunger and 
Malnutrition, and enhancing coherence among the different 
programmes of government, donors and NGOs are also 
fundamental in the fight against hunger. Haiti has made 
significant progress in developing food security-related 
coordination mechanisms and an institutional environment that 
is conducive to enhanced governance for food security. 

Recognition of the human right to food will bring new 
impetus to these efforts. In 2013, the Government of Haiti 
ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, which recognizes the right of all people to 
adequate nutrition and to live free from hunger. This 
ratification, along with proposals to establish a law on food 
security that are currently being discussed in Parliament, are 
clear steps that will help fortify and sustain the political 
commitment to meeting food security targets. 

Indonesia is the largest economy in South-Eastern Asia. 
Despite the global economic slowdown of recent years, 
Indonesia’s economy continues to grow steadily. 
Democratization, decentralization and greater political 
participation have improved governance and the peaceful 
resolution of regional conflicts. 

Since the Asian economic crisis of 1997–98, per capita 
GDP has increased by 65 percent, from US$1 057 in 1998 to 
US$1 731 in 2012.44 Strong economic growth has gradually 
reduced overall poverty in the country. The proportion of 
people living below the national poverty line decreased from 
23.4 percent in 1999 to 11.4 percent in 2013,45 and 
Indonesia has already achieved the MDG target for reducing 
extreme poverty.46 In 2009, the population living under the 
poverty line was 14 percent, or 32 million people. In March 
2014, 11 percent of the population lived below the poverty 
line.47

Despite these developments, income inequality is rising, 
as in many other countries in recent decades. The richest 

20 percent of the population has 80 percent of the country’s 
wealth, while about 43 percent lives on less than US$2 per 
day.48 There are striking disparities across the country, with 
poverty rates ranging from 3.5 percent in Jakarta to 
31.1 percent in West Papua.49

Reductions in extreme poverty have improved food 
security. According to FAO, Indonesia has achieved the MDG 
hunger target, by reducing the proportion of undernourished 
people from 19.7 percent of the population in 1990–92 to 
8.7 percent in 2012–14 (Figure 13). However, despite a 
substantial rise in the availability of dietary energy, Indonesia 
has made slower progress in reducing undernutrition. The 
most recent data suggest that the prevalence of stunting in 
children under five years of age was 37.2 percent in 2013 
(Figure 14), implying inadequate access to diverse foods to 
support good nutrition. 

Efforts have been made to strengthen the enabling 
environment to improve food security and nutrition, and 
legal frameworks and institutions for food security and

Strengthening the enabling environment to improve food security and nutrition

nutrition governance have evolved. In Indonesia, food self-
sufficiency has been a focus of food security policies since 
the Asian economic crisis of 1997–98, particularly in rice. 
After the food price surge in 2008, food self-sufficiency 
continues to dominate the political agenda, with policies that 
aim to attain self-sufficiency in rice and other major food 
commodities – maize, soybeans, beef and sugar – focusing 
on maintaining food prices that are affordable for lower-
middle-income communities, and increasing farm incomes.

Notably, the National Medium-Term Development Plan 
2010–2014 articulates the country’s approach to poverty 
reduction and development, with the government focusing 
on increasing food security and promoting inclusive growth, 
particularly in rural areas. Maintaining stable prices for rice – 
the main staple – has been a major element of the 
government’s food security policy since independence. Food 
consumption is still dominated by carbohydrates, particularly 
rice – a 10 percent increase in the price of rice leads to a 
1.3 percent increase in the poverty rate.50 Approximately half 
the country’s population lives in rural areas, and about 
34 percent of people depend mainly or exclusively on 
agriculture for their livelihoods, with rice being the main 
crop. Boosting agricultural productivity to improve the 
welfare of smallholder farmers through higher incomes is a 
desired policy outcome that is expected to lead to the 
reduction of poverty and food insecurity.

Several laws, together with establishment of the 
multistakeholder Food Security Council and the National 
Food Security Agency, form the overarching governance 
structure for food and nutrition security in Indonesia.51 
Important among these measures is Law No. 18 of 2012, 
which institutionalizes the human right to food and defines 
the state’s legal obligation to ensure the availability and 
affordability of sufficient, safe and nutritionally balanced 

food for all people at all times. In assuming this role, the 
government should utilize local resources, engage national 
institutions and respect cultural diversity. 

In 2013, Indonesia’s House of Representatives passed 
legislation to empower farmers by creating an environment 
with better infrastructure and facilities, stable food prices, 
and finance and support for farmers’ organizations in 
becoming more productive, modern and sustainable.52 
These laws call for the reform of institutions and provide 
the basis for policies that address both agricultural 
development and the immediate needs of the vulnerable. 
However, more efforts are needed to strengthen their 
enforcement and ensure effective governance. For 
example, although agricultural land is protected by law, its 
conversion to non-agricultural purposes is widespread and 
uncontrolled.53

The Food Security Council coordinates food security 
policies and programmes and is chaired by the President of 
Indonesia, with the Minister of Agriculture responsible as 
the chairperson-in-charge. The council’s secretariat is 
provided by the National Food Security Agency, hosted in 
the Ministry of Agriculture. Membership of the National 
Food Security Council comprises representatives from 16 
departments – including the Ministries of Social Affairs, 
Health, Education, Finance, Industry, Trade, Public Works, 
and Marine Affairs and Fisheries – two agencies, and NGOs; 
non-ministerial technical experts; and community leaders. 
Following decentralization, the council also has members at 
the district and municipal levels.54 Its annual national and 
regional meetings are attended by representatives from all 
regions and municipalities, facilitating coordination of the 
formulation and evaluation of policies. Decentralization has

Strengthening the enabling environment to improve food security and nutrition

had a significant impact on the effectiveness of agricultural 
development and food security programmes.

To achieve its range of objectives, the Food Security 
Council works through several technical working groups in 
specialized areas such as monitoring of rice prices, fertilizers, 
monitoring of food availability and distribution, the Food 
Security Information System, food insecurity maps, and 
nutrition.55

Food price stabilization is crucial for achieving food self-
sufficiency. At the operational level, one of the most 
important institutions in food security governance is the 
Food Logistics Agency (BULOG), which was founded in 
1969.56 A state-owned enterprise, BULOG has the mandate 
to balance the needs of producers and consumers and 
achieve food self-sufficiency targets by establishing buffer 
stocks, stabilizing domestic food prices and responding to 
food emergencies. Import restrictions are another important 
policy instrument in maintaining domestic prices at levels 
higher than those on the world market and promoting 
national self-sufficiency. 

As part of the reform of public institutions – a priority in 
the National Medium-Term Development Plan 2010–2014 – 
the government is considering moving the National Food 
Security Agency from the Ministry of Agriculture to the 
Office of the President as a way of broadening the policy mix 
and giving equal attention to both agricultural policies and 
measures that protect vulnerable population groups. 

Food security governance in Indonesia comprises a wide 
spectrum of policies. Fertilizer and seed subsidies have been 
an important part of the country’s agricultural development 
strategy in increasing agricultural productivity and food 
security and promoting technology adoption, and are also 
linked to the goal of self-sufficiency in rice production, 
which remains a priority for Indonesian policy-makers.57 The 
subsidies have had a positive impact on fertilizer use, 
resulting in increased rice yields. Nevertheless, the cost of 
the subsidy programme has increased in recent years, 
diverting government expenditures away from public goods, 
while also creating negative environmental impacts due to 
fertilizer runoff. 

Improvements in food security and nutrition are achieved 
through food subsidies for the poor, such as the Rice Subsidy 
for the Poor, which increases poor people’s access to the 
main food staple. In 2011, about 17.5 million poor 
households bought 3.15 million tonnes of rice at one-third 
of the market price.58 The National Community 
Empowerment Programme (PNPM) provides poor 
communities with grants for high-priority local programmes 
and projects. In rural areas, PNPM finances infrastructure 
investments, provides microcredit for women’s groups, and 
establishes social safety nets for the poorest and most 
vulnerable people. In a country spread over many islands, the 
Marine and Fisheries PNPM is particularly important; in 2011, 
it provided funds for direct community assistance to more 
than 1 000 fisher groups in 132 districts, more than 2 000 

farmers’ groups in 300 districts, and about 408 processing 
groups in 53 districts.59 From 2006 until 2013, the PNPM 
Programme has benefited 60 million Indonesians through 
thousands of PNPM projects in rural and urban areas.60

The ongoing Farmer Empowerment through Agricultural 
Technology and Information Project (FEATI) aims to improve 
the delivery of support services to farmers. The Sustainable 
Management of Agricultural Research and Technology 
Dissemination Project (SMARTD) complements FEATI by 
focusing on technology. SMARTD strengthens capacities to 
develop and disseminate best practice technologies and to 
improve sustainable agricultural productivity and incomes, 
particularly for women.61

The Development of Sustainable Home-Yard Food Garden 
programme (KRPL) has the objective of ensuring food security 
while diversifying consumption away from rice to improve 
nutrition. KRPL is an empowerment programme, reaching 
more than 1 million people and aiming to increase the use of 
home gardens for the production of tubers and vegetables. 
The programme promotes a diversified, nutritious and safe 
diet, and also helps to increase household incomes. The 
Development of Village Food Resilience project is a community 
empowerment programme that targets areas vulnerable to 
food insecurity with activities to expand livelihood options and 
achieve food security. Between 2006 and 2012, the 
programme reached more than 3 000 villages. The KRPL 
programme is targeted to reach 5 000 villages by 2014.

Significant efforts have strengthened the provision of food 
security information and monitoring, which is of paramount 
importance to the work of the Food Security Council. Food 
security and vulnerability atlases, produced at the national 
and regional levels, aim to improve geographical targeting of 
the people most in need. The Food and Nutrition Surveillance 
System (FNSS), launched in 2009, is an important tool for 
assessing food and nutrition insecurity at the household level. 
FNSS collects data on food security every three months, and 
data on the nutritional status of children under five years of 
age and their mothers twice a year.62 However, insufficient 
resources and an inadequate technological platform for data 
collection hinder the work of FNSS. 

Indonesia has made significant progress in establishing 
institutions and mechanisms that enhance food security 
governance, but challenges remain in ensuring that these 
systems have adequate financial and institutional support to 
function effectively. The Food Law (No. 18/2012) provides a 
solid regulatory framework for food security by declaring 
food a human right. It is expected that the law will be 
translated into decrees and applied by 2015. The overall 
success of this reformed food security policy and governance 
regime will depend on how effectively the Food Law is 
applied, especially at the local level. The weak capacities of 
Food Security Council offices at the regional, district and 
municipal levels are a major challenge, and building 
capacities at the local level will significantly improve the 
effectiveness of food security policies in Indonesia.

Strengthening the enabling environment to improve food security and nutrition

Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, 
ranking 151 of the 187 countries in the 2012 Human 
Development Index. The island is highly exposed to climate 
hazards – in recent decades, it has faced cyclones, droughts, 
floods and locust invasions. Such natural disasters have led 
to and exacerbated poverty and food insecurity.63 

More than 70 percent of the population lives on less than 
US$1/day, and poverty rates in rural areas are even higher.64 
Approximately 73 percent of the rural population is engaged 
in agricultural activities, livestock and fisheries, and most 
rural households practise subsistence farming. Six out of ten 
farming households cultivate less than 1.5 hectares of land 
each.65 Because of large family size and low agricultural 
productivity, most rural households are net food buyers. 
About 31 percent of the population was undernourished in 
2012–14, up from 27 percent in 1990–92 (Figure 15). About 
84 percent of the population obtain most of their calories 
(more than 75 percent) from staples, indicating that diets are 
of poor quality.66

Malnutrition is widespread, and about 47 percent of 
children under five years of age are chronically malnourished 
or stunted.67 Political instability has thwarted economic 
growth and strained relations with international donors. 
Average annual GDP growth fell from an average of 
5.6 percent in the five years before the political crisis of 
2009, to just 1.8 percent in the three years following.68

After a successful election in 2013, and the country’s 
reinstatement in the African Union, Madagascar is resuming 
relationships with bilateral and multilateral partners. 

However, despite the lifting of all trade and economic 
sanctions and most restrictions on foreign aid – imposed 
during the political crisis – overseas development assistance 
is not likely to reach pre-crisis levels in the next couple of 
years.

Before the political crisis, the government was taking 
action to improve the country’s development. Central to 
these efforts was the ambitious poverty reduction strategy, 
the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), which was to be 
implemented from 2007 to 2012. MAP outlined a strategy 
for achieving the MDGs and supporting the poorest and 
most vulnerable segments of the population. However, many 
of the policies articulated in MAP to stimulate growth and 
reduce poverty were never implemented.

Within the broader development context, Madagascar’s 
National Action Plan for Food Security was a ten-year 
strategy (2005–2015) for improving productivity, especially of 
rice, agricultural services, technology and nutrition 
education. However, the deepening political crisis prevented 
it and MAP from being implemented. Faced with a severe 
decline in fiscal revenues, resulting from the economic 
slowdown coupled with sharp reductions in financial support 
from development partners, government spending on social 
protection fell from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2008 to 
1.1 percent in 2010.69 Public spending on rural irrigation 
infrastructure and agricultural support services was also hit, 
as the transitional government focused on regaining 
macroeconomic stability.

Today, the signs are more promising. The government has 
recently presented the new General State Policy, which aims 
to put the country back on the path to development. Two of 
the 22 challenges that the policy addresses – revitalization of 
rural areas, and social protection – are related to agriculture 
and food security.

The government’s commitment to meeting these 
challenges is reflected by its establishment of the cross-
departmental National Compact, which envisions a 
competitive, sustainable and integrated agriculture sector 
that ensures food security in Madagascar by 2025. An array 
of measures, under the newly formulated Agriculture, 
Livestock and Fisheries Sector Programme (PSAEP), aim to 
increase rural incomes by 40 percent and reduce poverty by 
50 percent, by promoting agricultural productivity and 
sustainable use of natural resources. 

PSAEP’s policies focus on improving smallholders’ access 
to inputs by establishing seed and fertilizer centres and 
promoting investments in productive capital such as 
transport infrastructure, irrigation and equipment for fish 
farming. Other policies aim to strengthen preparedness and 
planning for food and nutrition emergencies; for example,

Strengthening the enabling environment to improve food security and nutrition

an integrated food security and nutrition programme 
implemented in 12 vulnerable regions provides a nutritional 
supplement for mothers and children, while also facilitating 
the distribution of improved seeds (especially vegetables) 
and improved availability of fishery products in local 
markets. The government has also started consolidating the 
new land policy, a process expected to be completed by 
March 2015, taking into account the indigenous rural and 
urban populations, and the need to focus on priorities such 
as food and nutrition security.

The National Nutrition Action Plan 2012–2015 (PNAN2) 
aims to reduce the prevalence of chronic malnutrition 
among children and to lower the proportion of the 
population consuming fewer than 2 300 kilocalories per day 
from 65 percent to 43 percent. Measures under PNAN2 
include promoting the cultivation of vegetables and 
micronutrient-rich foods, developing school feeding 
programmes, and providing fortified food and supplements 
to vulnerable groups. Its forerunner, PNAN1, was hampered 
by weak coordination and lack of ownership by 
stakeholders. PNAN2 has adopted a more inclusive 
approach, and benefits from joining the Scaling Up Nutrition 
initiative in 2012. However, strengthened coordination is 
needed to make PNAN2’s nutrition policies more effective. 

The Ministry of Public Health is responsible for nutrition 
policies, in collaboration with the Ministries of Agriculture 
and Rural Development, Livestock and Fisheries, Water and 
Sanitation, Economy and Finance, Education, Population, 
and Decentralization and Regional Planning. The United 
Nations, other international organizations and many NGOs70 
are partners in implementing PNAN2, together with these 
ministries, with the National Nutrition Office providing 
overall technical coordination. Although the country lacks 
resources for mechanisms to monitor food and nutrition, 
several international organizations generate food security 
information; for example, the Famine Early Warning Systems 
Network (FEWSNET), WFP, the World Bank and FAO conduct 
food security assessments and monitor trends. 

Non-governmental stakeholders implementing large-scale 
projects and other programmes include the World Bank, the 
African Development Bank, the United States Agency for 
International Development (USAID), United Nations agencies 
such as FAO, IFAD, WFP and the United Nations Children’s 
Fund (UNICEF), and the European Union. These programmes 
address problems ranging from weak investment to food 

insecurity and malnutrition, with interventions such as 
school feeding, cost exemptions and funding for the most 
vulnerable people attending health centres and hospitals, 
cash for work, control of locust outbreaks, and natural 
disaster response measures. They are coordinated through 
the Donors’ Group for Rural Development, Food Security 
and the Environment. The World Bank’s large-scale 
Emergency Food Security and Reconstruction Project (of 
US$40 million) aims to increase access to short-term 
employment in targeted food-insecure areas and to restore 
access to social and economic services following natural 
disasters, in targeted communities. 

Although the government has pledged to allocate at 
least 10 percent of the national budget to agriculture in 
line with the 2003 Maputo Declaration, public institutions – 
including the Ministries of Agriculture and Rural 
Development, Livestock and Animal Protection, Marine 
Resources and Fisheries, and Environment, Ecology and 
Forests – lack capacity and resources. For example, the 
Rural Information System on Food Security, established in 
2004, provided monthly information on agricultural 
production, weather and markets, but had to close when 
development assistance was cut. Currently, there is no 
coordinating institution, but the government is considering 
establishing an independent body, involving all relevant 
actors, to oversee policy coordination and guidance, 
advocate for funding and carry out impact evaluation of 
PSAEP. 

Political instability has seriously impeded the country’s 
progress in all areas of development. The crisis disrupted 
promising national strategies for food security and nutrition 
and the gaps left by the collapse of MAP were only partly 
filled by international organizations. Food security is the 
most urgent of the country’s development needs. As new 
national policies for nutrition, agriculture and response to 
natural disasters are formulated and implemented, it will be 
crucial to build the capacities of the institutions involved. 
Progress in addressing the underlying causes of hunger and 
food insecurity in Madagascar depends on establishing a 
mechanism that ensures effective coordination of different 
policies in agriculture, food security and nutrition. 
Enhanced coordination of food security policies can build 
an enabling environment in which more people can feed 
themselves with dignity while appropriate safety nets serve 
those unable to do so.

Strengthening the enabling environment to improve food security and nutrition

Malawi has met the MDG hunger target, although 
21.8 percent of the population remains undernourished 
(Figure 16). Malawi is one of the world’s least-developed 
countries, with a per capita GDP of about US$220 in 2012 (in 
constant 2005 United States dollars). Poverty is widespread. 
The latest estimates show that in 2010–11, 50.7 percent of 
the population lived below the national poverty line, 
compared with 52.4 percent in 2004–05. However, over the 
same period, ‘extreme poverty’ increased from 22.4 percent 
of the population to 24.5 percent, suggesting increasing rural 
inequality – a crucial issue for the country. 

In this small land-locked country in Eastern Africa, which 
shares boundaries with Mozambique, the United Republic of 
Tanzania and Zambia, the population is expanding rapidly. 
About 84 percent of the people live in rural areas with average 
access to 0.23 hectares of arable land per person, compared 
with the sub-Saharan African average of 0.40 hectares.71

Malawi’s agriculture is dominated by small subsistence 
farms, but is a major economic sector, contributing 
30 percent of GDP in 2011. Agriculture employs about 
80 percent of the workforce, and generates 83 percent of 
foreign exchange earnings. Maize, the main food staple, is 
grown on 70 percent of total arable area and is a major 
factor in the country’s food security.72 

Hunger and food inadequacy have been declining since 
2005, coinciding with a period of strong and persistent 
growth in maize production. However, in spite of the 
decreased prevalence of undernourishment, malnutrition 
remains a challenge – about 50 percent of children under five 

years of age are stunted and 12.8 percent are underweight, 
reflecting significant nutritional imbalances in their diets, 
which lack proteins, vitamins and other nutrients.73 Most 
people rely on maize and other starchy staples for their 
nutrition; average per capita maize consumption is 163 kg/
year, with households devoting an average of 40 percent of 
their food expenditure to buy this staple.

Food security and nutrition is a core priority of the Malawi 
Growth and Development Strategy 2011–2016, the country’s 
overarching development plan. Within this broad 
development plan, specific policies aim to increase food 
availability by strengthening agricultural productivity growth, 
promote food access through poverty reduction, improve 
nutrition through human resource development, and protect 
vulnerable population groups with productive safety nets 
and disaster preparedness. The commitment to food security 
and nutrition is reflected in the country’s Constitution, which 
acknowledges access to and utilization of sufficient and safe 
food as a human right. In line with the Maputo Declaration, 
the government emphasizes agriculture as the key driver of 
economic development and growth. 

A spectrum of policy measures have been implemented to 
meet the country’s food security objectives under the 
Agriculture Sector-Wide Approach Programme – the 
government’s investment framework for agriculture, which is 
aligned to the National Agriculture and Food Security 
Investment Plan of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture 
Development Programme (CAADP). The Farm Input Subsidy 
Programme is an important component of the country’s 
approach to increasing productivity, ensuring food security 
and reducing poverty. Launched in 2005, the programme 
benefits approximately half of all rural households, providing 
about 1.5 million with subsidized fertilizer and other inputs, 
such as maize and, to a lesser extent legume seeds, through 
a coupon system. Maize production has increased 
significantly since the start of programme implementation 
(Figure 17). Although it is difficult to isolate the impact of 
the programme from other factors, there is consensus that 
the subsidy has increased maize production and 
consumption at the household level, while also having a 
positive effect – through increases in income – on school 
enrolment among children aged five to 13 years.74 

Programmes under the Presidential Initiative on Poverty 
and Hunger Reduction, which were hosted in the Office of 
the President since 2012 and have now moved to the 
Ministry of Agriculture, aim to increase the welfare of the 
rural poor by promoting legume production to improve 
nutrition and income, increasing milk production through the 
distribution of cows and small animal stock, and developing 
fisheries and aquaculture. Crop insurance schemes

developed by the World Bank and Malawi’s National 
Association of Small Farmers help smallholders to manage 
weather risks such as drought, promote access to agricultural 
credit, and facilitate on-farm investment.75 

The Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation 
and the National Food Reserve Agency are central institutions in 
Malawi’s food security governance. The corporation manages 
the maize market through buffer stock operations, ensuring 
availability of the food staple; the Food Reserve Agency 
provides maize to poor households at subsidized prices. 

The National Nutrition Policy and Strategic Plan receives 
significant political support. Implemented by the Department 
of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS, which was established in 2004 to 
ensure that nutrition policies are well coordinated and is 
hosted in the Ministry of Health (it was moved from the 
Office of the President), the plan aims to improve nutrition 
and build the foundations for human resource development, 
economic growth and prosperity. The National Nutrition 
Policy is complemented by other measures, such as the 
National Nutrition Education and Communication Strategy 
2012–2016 and the National School Health and Nutrition 
Strategic Plan. Implementation of community-based nutrition 
interventions has been scaled up to 50 percent of districts, 
and focuses on reducing stunting.76 The National Social 
Support Policy covers an array of social protection 
programmes that focus on the vulnerable, promoting social 
welfare and food security and nutrition. 

Several government institutions are involved in the 
implementation and coordination of food security policies, 

creating a broad governance structure: the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development is responsible 
for formulating and implementing agricultural policies; the 
Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS coordinates nutrition 
measures; and the Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and 
Development is charged with coordinating and planning 
resilience and social protection programmes and disaster and 
risk management. Through its involvement in the Scaling Up 
Nutrition movement, the country has established high-level 
political committees such as the Cabinet Committee on 
Nutrition, HIV and AIDS; the Parliamentary Committee on 
Nutrition, HIV and AIDS, which is responsible for evaluating 
nutrition interventions; the Principal Secretaries’ Committee on 
Nutrition, HIV and AIDS; the Government and Development 
Partners Committee; and the National Nutrition Committee. 

At the district level, food security and nutrition policy is 
coordinated through district nutrition coordinating 
committees made up of representatives from relevant 
departments, civil society organizations and the private 
sector. Information – crucial for evidence-based policies – is 
provided by the Technical Working Group on Monitoring and 
Evaluation, composed of a wide variety of stakeholders from 
the public and non-state sectors and donors. 

Other stakeholders, including the private sector, civil 
society and producers’ groups, are also active participants in 
the food security and nutrition dialogue. At the national 
level, the Multi-Sectoral Technical Committee on Nutrition – 
made up of representatives from key ministries, donors, civil 
society organizations, academia, and research and advocacy

institutions – provides a platform for discussion of food 
security and nutrition policies. Donors could play a vital role 
in implementing and monitoring measures through the Joint 
Task Force on Food and Nutrition Security. 

Although Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the 
world, it has made progress in fighting hunger. Developing 
agriculture to enhance the welfare of rural people, increase 
food security and improve nutrition for the whole nation is a 
significant challenge. Agriculture in Malawi is mainly rain fed 
and prone to natural disasters, which result in crop failures. 
Slow progress in poverty reduction hinders access to food, 
while poor sanitation affects nutrition. 

Since 2012, poor macroeconomic performance has 
impeded progress towards development and food security. 
Economic shocks have necessitated large-scale relief 
operations, reaching almost two million people for two 
consecutive years. Together with devaluation of the currency, 

rising fertilizer prices put at risk the Farm Input Subsidy 
Programme – one of the country’s main agricultural 
development efforts. This programme accounts for 
70 percent of the total budget of the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Irrigation and Water Development and about 10 percent of 
the total national budget;77 with additional resources 
allocated to other agricultural programmes, Malawi 
dedicated 19 percent of its total annual budget to 
agriculture in 2012–13, surpassing the Maputo Declaration 
minimum threshold of 10 percent.78 

The government is facing serious challenges in coordinating 
the various policies and moving the food security and nutrition 
agenda forward. Strengthening the coherence of policy 
formulation, implementation and evaluation, and including all 
stakeholders – especially the international donor community, 
the private sector and civil society – are of paramount 
importance in achieving food security. 

Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a 
Human Development Index ranking of 160 out of 187 
countries. Progress in economic and social development over 
recent years has been slow, mainly as a result of the political 
crisis of 2011, ongoing instability and weak governance. The 
security situation is fragile and unpredictable, with conflict in 
the north, secessionists in the south and an increasing 
presence of militant groups, including Al-Qaeda.

Following the National Dialogue Conference, concluded 
in February 2014, Yemen currently has a transition 
government.79 A draft Constitution is being prepared, and 
elections are planned for 2015. As a result of the conflict, 
GDP growth plummeted from 5.2 percent in 2010 to 
–12.6 percent in 2011. Since then, economic growth has 
recovered somewhat, but has not regained its pre-crisis levels 
(Figure 18).

Strengthening the enabling environment to improve food security and nutrition

Conflict, economic downturn, low agricultural productivity, 
and poverty make Yemen one of the most food-insecure 
countries in the world. In 2012–14, 25.7 percent of the 
population was undernourished – just 3 percent less than in 
1990–92 (28.9 percent) (Figure 19). The conflict has 
significantly worsened diet diversity. Inadequate diets, 
measured by WFP’s food consumption score, increased by 
41 percent between 2009 and 2011,80 when 4.5 million 
people were severely food-insecure and 6 million moderately 
food-insecure.81 According to the World Health Organization 
(WHO) classification of malnutrition severity, the prevalence of 
stunted children under five years of age remains critical, with 
46.6 percent of children stunted or chronically malnourished.

The limited availability of land suitable for cultivation and 
water scarcity, caused by low and declining groundwater 
levels, affect food production, food security and rural 
incomes. Nearly two-thirds of the country’s people depend 
on agriculture, and more than 90 percent of water is used 
for irrigation.82 The narcotic leaf, qat, has become the 
preferred cash crop as it commands a high price on local 
markets; 40–50 percent of water for agriculture is used to 
irrigate qat.83 

With an average value of food production amounting to 
US$73 per capita in 2009–11, compared with an average of 
US$247 in Western Asia, Yemen is highly dependent on food 
imports. About 90 percent of wheat and 100 percent of rice, 
the country’s two main staples, are imported. Such high 
exposure to the international food market makes the country 
vulnerable to international food price surges. For example, 
between 2000–02 and 2008–10 – a period characterized by 
increasing world cereal prices – the share of merchandise 
export revenue used to buy food increased from 22 percent 
to 31 percent.84 Most export revenue comes from oil; in 
2010, more than 90 percent of foreign exchange earnings 
were from exports of oil and gas.85 

Oil exports have been reduced by attacks on the pipelines 
that carry crude oil to the ports, resulting in lower foreign 
exchange earnings and limiting the funds available for 
importing essential commodities, including food and fuel. In 
the medium term, Yemen will face a significant food security 
threat, as its oil reserves are expected to be exhausted by 
2017.86 The price and availability of both food and water are 
closely linked to the cost of fuel, which has been heavily 
subsidized. However, subsidies are being removed, causing 
civil unrest and exacerbating the fragile security situation. 
Higher fuel prices will have a significant impact on food 
prices, not only by adding to transport costs but also through 
increasing the cost of irrigation, which is operated by water 
pumps and diesel electricity generators. 

The government’s priorities are to restore political security 
and economic stability and to enhance state building through 
the Transitional Programme for Stabilization and Development. 
To support the restoration of stability, the National Food 
Security Strategy (NFSS) aims to reduce the prevalence of food 
insecurity by one-third by 2015; to make 90 percent of the 

population food-secure by 2020; and to reduce child 
malnutrition by at least one percentage point per year. To 
meet these goals, the NFSS action plan includes measures to 
decrease qat production and consumption, reduce Yemen’s 
vulnerability to global food price shocks and natural disasters, 
promote the sustainable use of water, increase public 
investment, and improve the provision of services.

Central to the implementation of NFSS are the National 
Agriculture Sector Strategy and Investment Plan 2012–2016 
and the National Water Sector Strategy and Investment 
Programme, which was initiated in 2004. In addition to 
reducing the cultivation of qat and increasing investments, 
the National Agriculture Sector Strategy and Investment Plan 
aims to enhance growth in domestic food productivity.87 
Efforts to fight poverty in rural areas, increase farm incomes 
and create more jobs are centred on measures to increase 
access to inputs – such as improved seed varieties for grains 
and oilseeds – and credit and to upgrade agricultural 
marketing. 

Significant efforts are also planned to reduce food waste, 
conserve the environment and natural resources, mainly 
through water management, and activate community 
participation to ensure that growth is sustainable. Water is 
crucial for Yemen and its agricultural development. Through 
the National Water Sector Strategy, the transitional 
government focuses on promoting the sustainable use of 
water and balancing the water needs of various communities 
and sectors.

To reduce the country’s vulnerability to international food 
price shocks, the government is discussing the possibility of 
establishing a strategic grain reserve. Such a reserve is 
considered vital for Yemen, which depends heavily on food 
imports to meet the consumption needs of its population. A 
strategic grain reserve linked to social protection and early

warning systems can facilitate the capacity to cope with food 
emergencies and protect the vulnerable. In addition, many 
economic activities and sectors, such as food and food 
processing, packaging and distribution, are dominated by 
small numbers of companies and actors, resulting in a lack of 
transparency.88 To stimulate competition in the food trade, 
the Yemen Economic Corporation imports food, accounting 
for between 5 and 10 percent of the country’s total cereal 
imports.

Tackling undernutrition is a significant challenge. The 
National Nutrition Strategy is a comprehensive multisector 
plan to reduce the high levels of undernutrition and improve 
the health of the population by 2020, and is closely linked to 
the nutrition objectives of NFSS. The strategy consists of 
systematic nutrition interventions at the household level, 
carried out by well-trained health workers and other 
stakeholders. Yemen joined the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) 
movement in 2012, and has established a SUN steering 
committee. However, the country still needs to adopt a far 
more integrated approach to coordinating programmes and 
aligning the overlapping objectives of food security and 
nutrition. 

Social safety nets have been crucial for enhancing the 
country’s food security and nutrition, with the Social Welfare 
Fund and the Social Fund for Development serving as the 
main mechanism for social protection. The Social Welfare 
Fund is an unconditional cash transfer programme funded 
largely by the government with international donor support. 
Coverage has expanded significantly from 100,000 beneficiary 
households in 1996 to more than 1 million in 2010, providing 
cash to half the country’s poor.89 However, lack of funds 
significantly limits the capacity of these two programmes to 
expand their coverage; the Social Welfare Fund has not made 
any payments to beneficiaries since January 2014.

Conflict and the economic downturn have made large-
scale humanitarian assistance necessary, with the Yemen 
Humanitarian Response Plan providing life-saving 
interventions for vulnerable and displaced people. Overall, 
humanitarian assistance in Yemen has increased dramatically; 
in 2014, funding for the activities planned by humanitarian 
assistance partners to meet the most urgent needs amounted 
to US$592 million, compared with US$293 million in 2011.90 

The Food Security Supreme Council, established in 2013, 
oversees implementation of NFSS and the National 
Agriculture Sector Strategy and Investment Plan. The 
Supreme Council, chaired by the Prime Minister, aims to 
strengthen coordination among government departments 
and to ensure a coherent approach to increasing food 
security. Its members include representatives from the 
Ministries of Agriculture and Irrigation, Social Affairs and 
Labour, Fisheries, Finance, Industry and Trade, Public Health 
and Population, Education, Water and Environment, and 
Transport, and the Central Statistical Organization. 
Participation of relevant stakeholders is ensured by the 
inclusion of high-level representatives from industry, the 

Agricultural Cooperative Union, the Consumer Protection 
Association and the Yemen Economic Corporation.

The Supreme Council has a strategic function in food 
security governance in Yemen. It sets objectives and priorities, 
maps strategies and policies, approves food security projects 
and programmes, allocates funds for implementation, and 
takes action in response to emergency and disaster situations. 
Its technical secretariat, hosted by the Ministry of Planning 
and International Cooperation, assists with these functions, 
ensuring that all relevant authorities implement policies in a 
coordinated way and significantly contributing to enhancing 
the country’s food security governance.

However, in spite of this food security governance 
architecture, weak commitment – caused mainly by political 
instability – and poor capacity in the civil service and 
monitoring systems hinder progress towards food security. 
Yemen’s economy depends increasingly on international 
assistance, but continues to suffer from low capacity to 
absorb these resources. The Friends of Yemen, established in 
2010 involving the foreign ministers of 39 countries, seeks to 
assist Yemen-led efforts to tackle the underlying causes of 
instability and to assist the political transition. With objectives 
that include directing international aid, increasing 
international awareness and sustaining international support, 
the Friends of Yemen pledged approximately US$8 billion in 
aid in 2012.91 At the request of donor countries, Yemen has 
established an executive bureau to coordinate international 
aid and facilitate the transfer of funds, which is often 
delayed by capacity constraints. Currently, the executive 
bureau is accountable for the effective and transparent use 
of international aid, while project planning and 
implementation are carried out by the relevant ministries. 

Effective food security monitoring and sound analysis are 
crucial for formulating evidence-based policies. Although 
there are large information gaps in Yemen, comprehensive 
food security assessments – undertaken by WFP in 2009, 
2011 and 2014 with support from FAO and UNICEF and the 
Central Statistical Organization – have provided vital 
information. Significant efforts have been made to establish 
the Humanitarian Early Warning Service (HEWS), provided by 
a global interagency partnership to support humanitarian 
emergency preparedness for multiple hazards. The Integrated 
Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is being piloted, and 
the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET) plans 
to establish a monitoring mechanism in 2014. 

Yemen’s economic growth prospects have been set back 
by conflict and political instability. Low agricultural 
productivity contributes significantly to poverty, as nearly 
two-thirds of the country’s people depend on agriculture for 
their livelihoods. Currently, about 5 million people depend on 
food assistance. Owing to the political crisis, implementation 
of NFSS, developed in response to the 2008 global food 
price surge, has only recently started. NFSS, the National 
Agriculture Sector Strategy and Investment Plan and the 
National Water Sector Strategy are currently being

Strengthening the enabling environment to improve food security and nutrition

revitalized, with new institutional mechanisms to facilitate 
implementation across a wide range of ministries. 

The success of these mechanisms depends largely on 
political developments, restitution of the rule of law and 
significant improvements in the capacity of implementing 
institutions. To end hunger, political commitment is crucial. 
The National Dialogue Conference, which resulted in the 

transitional government, has underlined the need to recognize 
the right to food as a constitutional human right, supported 
by appropriate laws. Through the newly created Ministry of 
Human Rights, the government is making progress in 
achieving consensus on this right as a step towards developing 
the necessary legal and institutional framework to underpin 
the formulation and implementation of food security policies.

Food insecurity and malnutrition are the result of a 
complex interplay of factors. Hunger and hidden 
hunger (micronutrient deficiencies) deprive people 
of the most valuable resource they own: the energy 
and skill to work productively. Civil unrest and 
conflict, natural disasters, extreme weather events 
and economic crises complicate efforts to effectively 
deal with extreme poverty, food insecurity and 
malnutrition. 

Creating an enabling environment for food security 
and nutrition is key to eradicating hunger; it entails 
sharpening the focus of policies and programmes and 
of stakeholders on food security and nutrition.

•	 Sustained political commitment at the highest 
level is a prerequisite to hunger eradication, as 
in Malawi where political will was crucial. It 
entails placing food security and nutrition at the 
top of the political agenda, and facilitates 
implementation of necessary policies, programmes 
and institutional reforms, including to maintain 
peace and stability and to reduce vulnerability.

•	 Social participation and involvement of a wide 
range of stakeholders in policy processes are 
crucial. Strong democratic principles and effective 
inclusion of all stakeholders in the formulation 
and implementation of food security and 
nutrition policies at various levels, as in Brazil, 
can ensure that even politically weak groups 
have voice, resulting in more equitable policies 
that better address the needs of the vulnerable. 

•	 Legal frameworks contribute by helping to 
ensure that government, civil society and formal 
and informal groups work together responsibly. 
However, political crises often render crucial 
institutions and processes less effective, 
compromising efforts to improve food security 
and nutrition outcomes.

Key findings

•	 A coherent approach must ensure 
complementarities among agriculture, food, 
economic, health, environmental, education 
and other relevant sectors, e.g. for more 
coordinated and effective public investments. 

•	 Better coordination and governance 
mechanisms are essential, and require strong 
political support at the highest level, a clear 
mandate, broad inclusion and well-defined 
roles and responsibilities, as in Bolivia. 
Countries have sometimes put in place 
redundant, incoherent or even contradictory 
food security and nutrition programmes and 
policies, designed and implemented by 
different ministries and agencies. In such 
circumstances, actions become highly 
fragmented as responsibility and accountability 
are diffused among many bodies, each with its 
own mandate and policy objectives. 

•	 Policies and programmes are most effective 
when based on sound analysis and using 
appropriate, accessible and inclusive 
information systems. The integrated use of 
demonstrably effective policy tools and 
instruments promoted agricultural and rural 
development, food security and nutrition 
through: public and private investments to 
raise agricultural productivity; better access to 
inputs, land, services, technologies and 
markets; measures to promote rural 
development; social protection for the most 
vulnerable, including strengthening their 
resilience to shocks and natural hazards; and 
specific nutrition programmes, especially to 
address micronutrient deficiencies in mothers 
and children under five.

Annex 2

the distribution of per capita calorie consumption derived 
from national household surveys (NHS)96 is applied as a 
selection criterion. Using the skewness implied by the 
lognormal as an upper limit for the level of asymmetry, the 
skew-lognormal, which embeds the lognormal as a special 
case, is used as an intermediate step to the skew-normal 
distribution, which itself is a more general form of the normal 
distribution. The resulting model makes it possible to account 
for reductions in inequality of food consumption, such as 
those made by targeted food intervention programmes, 
ensuring a smooth transition towards a distribution in which 
food consumption is symmetric.

 ■ Estimating and projecting mean food consumption 

To compute per capita DEC in a country, FAO has traditionally 
relied on food balance sheets, which are available for more than 
180 countries. In most countries this choice was due mainly to the 
lack of suitable surveys conducted regularly. Through data on 
production, trade and utilization of food commodities, the total 
amount of dietary energy available for human consumption in a 
country for a one-year period is derived using food composition 
data, allowing computation of an estimate of per capita dietary 
energy supply. 

During the revision for The State of Food Insecurity in the 
World 2012 a parameter that captures food losses during 
distribution at the retail level was introduced in an attempt to 
obtain more accurate values of per capita consumption. Region-
specific calorie losses were estimated from data provided in a 
recent FAO study97 and ranged from 2 percent of the quantity 
distributed for dry grains, to 10 percent for perishable products 
such as fresh fruits and vegetables. 

The latest data from food balance sheets refer to 2011; 
therefore, additional sources were needed to estimate the DEC for 
the last three years, 2012–14. The main source for 2012 and 
2013 estimates was projections prepared by the Trade and Market 
Division of FAO. The Holt-Winters distributed lag model was used 
to project the DEC for 2014; in some cases, this model was also 
applied to compute projections for 2012 and 2013, when data 
from the Trade and Market Division were not available or 
unreliable. The Holt-Winters model uses a process known as 
exponential smoothing, which attributes higher weights to more 
recent data and progressively less weight to older observations. 
Weights decrease in each period by a constant amount, which lies 
on an exponential curve. For countries showing peculiar patterns, 
other simpler forecasting models were used, such as linear or 
exponential trends.

 ■ Estimating coefficients of variation and skewness 

A new data treatment method
Variability (CV) and skewness (SK) parameters are derived from 
NHS wherever they are available and reliable. These surveys 
typically collect information on food as part of the expenditure 
module. Data from these surveys, when taken as observations of 
individual habitual consumption, are affected by high variability. It 
is therefore essential to apply data treatment methods before 

Prevalence of undernourishment 
indicator

The FAO prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) indicator 
monitors progress towards Millennium Development Goal target 
1C of halving, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people 
suffering from hunger.92 Estimates of the number of 
undernourished (NoU) – calculated by multiplying the PoU by the 
size of the reference population – are used to monitor progress 
towards the World Food Summit goal of reducing by half the 
number of people suffering from undernourishment.93 

The PoU indicator measures the probability that a randomly 
selected individual from the reference population is found to 
consume less than his/her calorie requirement for an active and 
healthy life. It is written as:

where f(x) is the probability density function of per capita calorie 
consumption. The probability distribution used to infer the habitual 
levels of dietary energy consumption in a population, f(x), refers to 
a typical level of daily energy consumption during a year. As such, 
f(x) does not reflect the possible implications of insufficient food 
consumption levels that may prevail over shorter periods. The 
probability distribution f(x) and the minimum dietary energy 
requirement (MDER) are associated with a representative individual of 
the population, of average age, sex, stature and physical activity level. 

Estimating the PoU requires the identification of a functional 
form for f(x), chosen from a parametric family. The parameters 
that characterize f(x) are the mean level of per capita dietary 
energy consumption (DEC) in calories; the MDER; the coefficient 
of variation (CV) as a parameter accounting for inequality in food 
consumption; and a skewness (SK) parameter accounting for 
asymmetry in the distribution. 

To implement this methodology it is necessary to: (i) choose a 
functional form for the distribution of food consumption f(x); (ii) 
identify values for the three parameters, that is, for mean food 
consumption (DEC), its variability (CV) and its asymmetry (SK); and 
(iii) compute the MDER threshold. 

 ■ The choice of a functional form for the distribution 

Starting from the Sixth World Food Survey in 1996,94 the 
distribution was assumed to be lognormal. This model is very 
convenient for analytical purposes, but has limited flexibility, 
especially in capturing the skewness of the distribution. 

As part of the revisions made for the 2012 edition The State of 
Food Insecurity in the World, the methodology moved away from 
the exclusive use of the two-parameter lognormal distribution to 
adopt the more flexible three-parameter skew-normal and skew-
lognormal families.95 The flexibility gained from the additional 
parameter allows for independent characterization of the 
asymmetry of the distribution. 

As a further refinement, the data themselves are used in 
this report to inform the decision regarding the appropriate 
distributional form. In this way, the empirical skewness from 



T H E  S T A T E  O F  F O O D  I N S E C U R I T Y  I N  T H E  W O R L D   2 0 1 4 47

Annex 2

parameters are estimated. This is especially the case for the SK 
parameter, which is sensitive to the presence of extreme values.98

The method applied in this edition of The State of Food 
Insecurity in the World to assess the robustness of statistics for a 
sample is known as the “leave-out-one cross-validation” approach. 
With this approach, for a sample of size n, subsamples of size 
(n – 1) are created in which each observation is systematically left 
out of one subsample. For each subsample, the sensitivity of the 
statistic of interest – in this case, the SK parameter – to the 
excluded observation can be analysed, and observations that have 
a large impact are removed. The method allows a robust 
calculation of the SK parameter that is insensitive to any single 
observation found in the dataset.

Controlling for excess variability
As the original purpose of NHS is to measure the levels and 
changes in living conditions of the population, the data collected 
typically pertain to food acquisition over a given reference period. 
However, the aim of the food security analyses in this report is to 
capture habitual food consumption, which is expected to be less 
variable than food acquisition. Therefore, excess variability is 
controlled by assuming a stable relationship between income and 
consumption in calories, which nets out excess variability caused by 
some households boosting their food stocks while other 
households deplete theirs. In the past, this control for excess 
variability has been accomplished by grouping household food 
consumption levels according to income deciles.99

In this edition of The State of Food Insecurity in the World an 
extension of the method described above is used, based on a linear 
regression linking the log of per capita income to per capita calorie 
consumption, along with indicator variables for the month in 
which the survey was conducted, to control for seasonality. The 
regression can be written as:

where PPCi is the per capita calorie consumption for household i, 
β0 is an intercept term, β1 is a regression parameter defining the 
linear relationship between the log of income and food 
consumption, and Monthj,i is an indicator variable with value 1 if 
the survey for household i took place in month j. The variability in 
food consumption due to income is then calculated from the fitted 
values of the regression adjusted for seasonality. 

A new estimation of indirect CVs
The procedure described so far is employed in countries where one 
or more reliable NHS are available. Where this is not the case, 
so-called indirect estimates for the variability in food consumption 
are used. Indirect CVs were estimated by using the relationships 
between the CVs obtained from available household survey data 
and some key macroeconomic variables. In the past, the PoU 
indicator methodology was frequently criticized for holding CVs – 
which account for inequality in food consumption – constant over 
time for most countries.100 This practice does not take into account 
economic progress within a country and changes in the distribution 
of food consumption. To address this issue, in this report, indirect 
estimates have been updated from 2000 onwards by using a revised 

relationship among the CVs due to income and macroeconomic 
variables that also takes into account changes in food prices. 

To fully investigate the effects of food prices changes on food 
access, measures of national prices should be used. In collaboration 
with the World Bank, FAO has developed a relative price of food 
indicator using data from the International Comparison Program101 
and consumer food price indices available on FAOSTAT.102 The 
indicator is designed to capture changes in domestic food prices 
that are comparable over time and among countries. The ratio of 
food and general consumption in purchasing power parity (PPP) 
terms is projected forwards and backwards in time using the ratio 
of the country’s consumer food price index to the country’s general 
consumer price index, relative to that of the United States of 
America.

Using the most comprehensive dataset of Gini coefficients 
available,103 a regression has been used to relate the variability in 
food consumption due to income to the log of GDP, the Gini 
coefficient, and the log of the relative price of food indicator. The 
GDP and relative price of food indicators are included on the log-
scale, implying that changes in these variables at low values will 
have a larger impact on the CV due to income. To ensure cross-
country comparability at different points in time, per capita GDP in 
constant 2005 international dollars in PPP terms, calculated by the 
World Bank, has been used. Regional indicators have been 
included for Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Western Asia. An 
interaction term between the GDP and the relative food price 
indicator has been included to allow for differential effects of the 
price of food at different levels of GDP. As there are multiple 
observations – more than one survey – for some countries, a 
weighted regression was used in which each observation is 
weighted by one over the number of surveys for that country. 

With the parameters from the regression described above, the 
variability in food consumption due to income has been updated for 
countries with available Gini coefficients and available data on the 
relative price of food and GDP. Note that the Gini coefficients in the 
World Bank database differ in terms of whether they are calculated 
with reference to the household or the individual, consumption or 
expenditure, and gross or net income – these differences can make 
comparability across different types of Gini coefficients difficult.104 
For this reason, care was taken to ensure that the same type of Gini 
calculation was used within a single country and, to maintain cross-
country comparability, only relative changes in the predicted values 
from the regression were used to update the CV parameter. The 
resulting updates take into account economic progress in a country 
as well as changes in relative food prices, allowing for a more 
complete picture of inequality in food consumption. 

A new computation of variability due to requirement
To obtain the total variability in food consumption used to 
calculate the PoU, the variability that is due to income ( ) is 
added to the variability due to all other factors that are not 
correlated with income ( ):

Much of the variability orthogonal to income is due to 
differences in energy requirement, which are in turn largely 



T H E  S T A T E  O F  F O O D  I N S E C U R I T Y  I N  T H E  W O R L D   2 0 1 448

Annex 2

determined by population structure as well as by physical activity 
levels, life styles, access to safe drinking-water, and progress in 
health care and disease reduction. Previous analyses showed small 
variability in this subcomponent across countries and over time, 
compared with the income component, and the variability due to 
requirement has been maintained at a fixed value. 

To take into account the world’s rapidly changing population 
structure,105 time-varying country estimates for the variability in 
food consumption due to requirement have been calculated. 
Using estimates for the average dietary energy requirement by sex 
and age class106 and corresponding population ratios107 as weights, 
the variance due to requirement is estimated for a given country in 
a given year. Further work is under way to capture the rest of the 
variability that is orthogonal to income. The revision discussed here 
allows estimates of the variability in food consumption to reflect 
more accurately demographic differences across countries and 
demographic evolution within a country.

 ■ Estimating the MDER threshold 

To calculate the MDER threshold, FAO employs normative energy 
requirement standards from a joint FAO/WHO/United Nations 
University expert consultation in 2001. These standards are 
obtained by calculating the needs for basic metabolism – that is, 
the energy expended by the human body in a state of rest – and 
multiplying them by a factor that takes into account physical 
activity, referred to as the physical activity level (PAL) index. 

As individual metabolic efficiency and physical activity levels 
vary within population groups of the same age and sex, energy 
requirements are expressed as ranges for such groups. To derive 
the MDER threshold, the minimum of each range for adults and 
adolescents is specified on the basis of the distribution of ideal 
body weights and the mid-point of the values of the PAL index 
associated with a sedentary lifestyle (1.55). The lowest body 
weight for a given height that is compatible with good health is 
estimated from the fifth percentile of the distribution of body 
mass indices in healthy populations. 

Once the minimum requirement for each sex-age group has 
been established, the population-level MDER threshold is obtained 
as a weighted average, considering the relative frequency of 
individuals in each group as weights. The threshold is determined 
with reference to light physical activity, normally associated with a 
sedentary lifestyle. However, this does not negate the fact that the 
population also includes individuals engaged in moderate and 
intense physical activity. It is just one way of avoiding the 
overestimation of food inadequacy when only food consumption 
levels are observed that cannot be individually matched to the 
varying requirements. 

A frequent misconception when assessing food inadequacy 
based on observed food consumption data is to refer to the mid-
point in the overall range of requirements as a threshold for 
identifying inadequate energy consumption in the population. This 
would lead to significantly biased estimates: even in groups 
composed of only well-nourished people, roughly half of these 
individuals will have intake levels below mean requirements, as the 
group will include people engaged in low physical activity. Using 
the mean requirement as a threshold would certainly produce an 

overestimate, as all adequately nourished individuals with less 
than average requirements would be misclassified as 
undernourished.108

MDER thresholds are updated every two years based on regular 
revisions of the population assessments of the United Nations 
Population Division and data on population heights from various 
sources, most notably the Monitoring and Evaluation to Assess 
and Use Results of Demographic and Health Surveys project 
coordinated by the United States Agency for International 
Development (USAID). This edition of The State of Food Insecurity 
in the World uses updated population estimates from the 2012 
revision published by the United Nations Population Division in 
June 2013. When data on population heights are not available, 
reference is made either to data on heights from countries where 
similar ethnicities prevail, or to models that use partial information 
to estimate heights for various sex and age classes.

 ■ Limitations of the methodology and frequent 
critiques 

The FAO methodology for estimating undernourishment has been 
subject to long-standing and wide debate. The methodology 
suffers from several limitations, which need to be acknowledged 
and taken into account when analysing the results presented in 
this report. 

First, the indicator is based on a narrow definition of hunger, 
covering only chronically inadequate dietary energy intake lasting 
for over one year. Energy intake is a very specific aspect of food 
insecurity, which applies where conditions are more severe. 
Individuals experiencing difficulties in obtaining enough food are 
likely to switch towards cheaper sources of energy and to 
compromise the quality of their food intake in a way that can 
create substantial damage.109 To address this limitation, the FAO 
suite of food security indicators has been presented since the 
2012 edition of The State of Food Insecurity in the World. The 
suite comprises indicators that reflect a broader concept of food 
insecurity and hunger and allows consideration of their 
multifaceted nature. 

Second, the PoU indicator cannot capture within-year 
fluctuations in the capacity to acquire enough energy from food, 
which may themselves be causes of significant stresses for the 
population. Within-year fluctuations can also affect the quality of 
the diet, as consumers will resort to cheaper foods during periods 
when access becomes more difficult. 

Third, the FAO methodology for computing undernourishment 
cannot take into account any bias that may exist in intra-
household distribution of foods,110 such as that arising from 
cultural habits or gender-based habits and beliefs. As seen, the 
parameters that describe the distribution of food across the 
population are derived from household-level surveys, rather than 
from information that refers to individuals. 

A final and significant limitation of the FAO methodology for 
computing the prevalence of undernourishment is that it does not 
provide information on the degree of severity of the food 
insecurity conditions experienced by a population. The parametric 
model described in this annex only allows for estimates of the 
undernourished share in a population, but is essentially silent

Annex 2

about the composition of undernourishment within that part of 
the population. 

In the debate on measuring undernourishment, the FAO 
methodology has frequently attracted two criticisms: 
•	 The indicator underestimates undernourishment, as it assumes 

a level of physical activity associated with a sedentary lifestyle, 
while poor people are often engaged in physically demanding 
activities.

•	 The methodology is based on macrodata, whereas microdata 
from surveys allow accurate measurement of food 
consumption.
On the first criticism, ideally, undernourishment should be 

assessed at the individual level by comparing individual energy 
requirements with individual energy intakes. This would enable 
the classification of each person in the population as 
undernourished or not. However, this approach is not feasible for 
two reasons: individual energy requirements are practically 
unobservable with standard data collection methods; and 
individual food consumption is currently measured with precision 
in only a few countries and for relatively limited samples. The 
individual-level consumption data that can be estimated from NHS 
are largely approximated owing to disparities in intra-household 
food allocation, the variability of individual energy requirements, 
and the day-to-day variability of food consumption that can arise 
for reasons independent of food insecurity. The solution adopted 
by FAO has been to estimate the PoU with reference to the 
population as a whole, summarized through a representative 
individual, and to combine available microdata on food 
consumption with macrodata. Within the population, there is a 
range of values for energy requirements that are compatible with 
healthy status, given that body weight, metabolic efficiency and 
physical activity levels vary. It follows that only values below the 
minimum of such a range can be associated with 
undernourishment, in a probabilistic sense. Hence, for the PoU to 

indicate that a randomly selected individual in a population is 
undernourished, the appropriate threshold is the lower end of the 
range of energy requirements.

As for the second criticism, the FAO methodology in fact 
combines available microdata on food consumption derived from 
surveys with macrodata from food balance sheets. Food balance 
sheets provide information on the amount of food that is available 
for consumption after taking into account all the possible 
alternative uses of the food items; hence, they provide 
approximate measures of per capita consumption, which are 
available for a large number of countries and are comparable. The 
methodology adopted for computing these data is currently under 
revision, together with the estimates of waste parameters 
employed to derive the DEC, so the level of accuracy is expected 
to increase in the next few years. Survey data, where available and 
reliable, are employed in the FAO methodology to compute the 
variability (CV) and skewness (SK) parameters that characterize the 
distribution of food consumption f(x). It is therefore essential that 
household surveys collecting food consumption data are improved 
to obtain more accurate measures of undernourishment. Such 
improvements will require both promoting greater standardization 
across NHS, and conducting more refined surveys that capture 
food intake at the individual level. At the moment, few surveys 
accurately capture habitual food consumption at the individual 
level and collect sufficient information on the anthropometric 
characteristics and activity levels of each surveyed individual; in 
other words, very few surveys would allow for an estimation of 
the relevant energy requirement threshold at the individual level.

To conclude, the quality of the PoU estimates depends heavily 
on the quality of the background data employed in the estimation. 
Hence, to obtain better estimates on undernourishment it is 
important to improve food consumption data through the design 
and implementation of high-quality nationally representative 
surveys that are comparable over time and across countries.

Annex 3

Glossary of selected terms used in the report

Anthropometry. Use of human body measurements to obtain information 
about nutritional status.

Body mass index (BMI). The ratio of weight-for-height measured as the 
weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres.

Dietary energy intake. The energy content of food consumed.

Dietary energy requirement (DER). The amount of dietary energy required 
by an individual to maintain body functions, health and normal activity.

Dietary energy supply (DES). Food available for human consumption, 
expressed in kilocalories per person per day (kcal/person/day). At 
country level, it is calculated as the food remaining for human use after 
deduction of all non-food utilizations (i.e. food = production + 
imports + stock withdrawals − exports − industrial use − animal feed – 
seed – wastage − additions to stock). Wastage includes losses of usable 
products occurring along distribution chains from farm gate (or port of 
import) up to the retail level.

Dietary energy supply adequacy. Dietary energy supply as a percentage of 
the average dietary energy requirement.

Food insecurity. A situation that exists when people lack secure access to 
sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal growth and 
development and an active and healthy life. It may be caused by the 
unavailability of food, insufficient purchasing power, inappropriate 
distribution or inadequate use of food at the household level. Food 
insecurity, poor conditions of health and sanitation and inappropriate 
care and feeding practices are the major causes of poor nutritional 
status. Food insecurity may be chronic, seasonal or transitory.

Food security. A situation that exists when all people, at all times, have 
physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious 
food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active 
and healthy life. Based on this definition, four food security dimensions 
can be identified: food availability, economic and physical access to 
food, food utilization and stability over time.

Hunger. In this report the term hunger is used as being synonymous with 
chronic undernourishment.

Kilocalorie (kcal). A unit of measurement of energy. One kilocalorie equals 
1 000 calories. In the International System of Units (SI), the universal 
unit of energy is the joule (J). One kilocalorie = 4.184 kilojoules (kJ). 

Macronutrients. In this document, the proteins, carbohydrates and fats that 
are available to be used for energy. They are measured in grams.

Malnutrition. An abnormal physiological condition caused by inadequate, 
unbalanced or excessive consumption of macronutrients and/or 
micronutrients. Malnutrition includes undernutrition and overnutrition 
as well as micronutrient deficiencies.  

 
Micronutrients. Vitamins, minerals and certain other substances that are 

required by the body in small amounts. They are measured in 
milligrams or micrograms. 

Minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER). In a specified age/sex category, 
the minimum amount of dietary energy per person that is considered 
adequate to meet the energy needs at a minimum acceptable BMI of an 
individual engaged in low physical activity. If referring to an entire 
population, the minimum energy requirement is the weighted average of 
the minimum energy requirements of the different age/sex groups. It is 
expressed as kilocalories per person per day.

Nutrition security. A situation that exists when secure access to an 
appropriately nutritious diet is coupled with a sanitary environment, 
adequate health services and care, in order to ensure a healthy and 
active life for all household members. Nutrition security differs from 
food security in that it also considers the aspects of adequate caring 
practices, health and hygiene in addition to dietary adequacy. 

Nutrition-sensitive intervention. Interventions designed to address the underlying 
determinants of nutrition (which include household food security, care for 
mothers and children and primary health care services and sanitation) but 
not necessarily having nutrition as the predominant goal.

Nutritional status. The physiological state of an individual that results from 
the relationship between nutrient intake and requirements and from 
the body’s ability to digest, absorb and use these nutrients.

Overnourishment. Food intake that is continuously in excess of dietary energy 
requirements.

Overnutrition. A result of excessive food intake relative to dietary nutrient 
requirements.

Overweight and obesity. Body weight that is above normal for height as a 
result of an excessive accumulation of fat. It is usually a manifestation 
of overnourishment. Overweight is defined as a BMI of more than 25 
but less than 30 and obesity as a BMI of 30 or more. 

Stunting. Low height for age, reflecting a past episode or episodes of 
sustained undernutrition. 

Undernourishment. A state, lasting for at least one year, of inability to acquire 
enough food, defined as a level of food intake insufficient to meet 
dietary energy requirements. For the purposes of this report, hunger 
was defined as being synonymous with chronic undernourishment.

Undernutrition. The outcome of undernourishment, and/or poor absorption 
and/or poor biological use of nutrients consumed as a result of repeated 
infectious disease. It includes being underweight for one’s age, too short 
for one’s age (stunted), dangerously thin for one’s height (wasted) and 
deficient in vitamins and minerals (micronutrient malnutrition).

Underweight. Low weight for age in children, and BMI of less than 18.5 in 
adults, reflecting a current condition resulting from inadequate food 
intake, past episodes of undernutrition or poor health conditions.

Wasting. Low weight for height, generally the result of weight loss associated 
with a recent period of starvation or disease.

1 The country classification adopted in this 
report is the United Nations M49 
classification (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/
methods/m49/m49.htm). Following the 
creation of the Republic of South Sudan in 
July 2011, the M49 classification 
considered the Sudan as part of the 
Northern Africa region, and South Sudan 
as part of Eastern Africa. In this report, 
data for the Sudan are therefore included 
in the Northern Africa region. 

2 The suite of indicators was developed by 
FAO in response to a request of the 
Committee on World Food Security 
expressed at a round table to review the 
methods used to estimate the number of 
hungry people (available at http://www.
fao.org/cfs/cfs-home/cfsroundtable1/en/). 
A comprehensive description of the 
methodology used to obtain this indicator 
and its limitations is included in Annex 2. 

3 Data coverage for these indicators is 
limited to a few countries and years. Data 
limitations are flagged in the metadata file 
accompanying the suite of indicators. The 
limited availability of data also prevents 
the inclusion of other important factors of 
food utilization, such as changing diets, 
dietary diversity, breastfeeding practices or 
maternal education.

Notes for Annex 1
Countries revise their official statistics regularly for the past as well as the latest reported 
period. The same holds for population data of the United Nations. Whenever this 
happens, FAO revises its estimates of undernourishment accordingly. Therefore, users are 
advised to refer to changes in estimates over time only within the same edition of  
The State of Food Insecurity in the World and refrain from comparing data published in 
editions for different years.

Countries, areas and territories for which there were insufficient or not reliable data to 
conduct the assessment are not reported. These include: American Samoa, Andorra, 
Anguilla, Aruba, Bahrain, Bhutan, British Virgin Islands, Burundi, Canton and Enderbury 
Islands, Cayman Islands, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Cook Islands, Comoros, 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Faeroe Islands, 
French Guiana, French Polynesia, Greenland, Guadeloupe, Guam, Holy See, Johnston 
Island, Libya, Liechtenstein, Marshall Islands, Martinique, Micronesia (Federated States 
of), Midway Islands, Monaco, Nauru, Netherlands Antilles, New Caledonia, Niue, Norfolk 
Island, Northern Mariana Islands, Oman, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Pitcairn Islands, 
Puerto Rico, Qatar, Réunion, Saint Helena, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Saint Kitts and 
Nevis, San Marino, Seychelles, Singapore, Somalia (the Federal Republic of), Syrian Arab 
Republic, Tokelau, Tonga, Turks and Caicos Islands, Tuvalu, United States Virgin Islands, 
Wake Island, Wallis and Futuna Islands, Western Sahara. 

1.  World Food Summit goal: halve, between 1990–92 and 2015, the number of people 
undernourished.

2.  Millennium Development Goal 1, target 1C: halve, between 1990–92 and 2015, 
the proportion of people suffering from undernourishment, or reduce this proportion 
below 5 percent. Indicator 1.9 measures the proportion of population below minimum 
level of dietary energy consumption (undernourishment). The results are obtained 
following a harmonized methodology and are based on the latest globally available 
data averaged over three years. Some countries may have more recent data which, 
if used, could lead to different estimates of the prevalence of undernourishment and 
consequently of the progress achieved.

3.  Projection.

4.  Change from the 1990–92 baseline. For countries that did not exist in the baseline 
period, the 1990–92 proportion of undernourished is based on the 1993–95 
proportion, while the number of people undernourished is based on this proportion of 
their 1990–92 population. For countries where the prevalence of undernourishment is 
estimated to be below 5 percent, the change in the number of people undernourished 
since the 1990–92 baseline is only assessed as: achieving the WFS target, i.e. 
reducing the number by more than half (<–50.0%); progress, but insufficient to 
achieve the WFS target, i.e. reducing the number by less than half (>–5 0%); or an 
increase in the number of people undernourished (>0.0%). 

5.  The color indicator shows the progress that is projected to be achieved by year 2015, 
if observed trends continue:

WFS target MDG target 

p No progress, or deterioration ¢ No progress, or deterioration 

tu Progress insufficient to 
reach the WFS target if 
observed trends persist

¢ Progress insufficient to 
reach the MDG target 1C if 
observed trends persist

q WFS target expected to be 
met by 2015 if observed 
trends persist

¢ MDG target 1C expected to 
be met by 2015 if observed 
trends persist

2014
The State of  

Food Insecurity in the World 
The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2014 presents updated 
estimates of undernourishment and progress towards the 
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) and World Food Summit 
(WFS) hunger targets. A stock-taking of where we stand on 
reducing hunger and malnutrition shows that progress in hunger 
reduction at the global level and in many countries has continued 
but that substantial additional effort is needed in others. 

The 2014 report also presents further insights into the suite of food 
security indicators introduced in 2013 and analyses in greater depth 
the dimensions of food security – availability, access, stability and 
utilization. By measuring food security across these dimensions, 
the suite of indicators can provide a detailed picture of the food 
security and nutrition challenges in a country, thus assisting in the 
design of targeted food security and nutrition interventions. 

Sustained political commitment at the highest level is a prerequisite 
for hunger eradication. It entails placing food security and nutrition 
at the top of the political agenda and creating an enabling 
environment for improving food security and nutrition. This year’s 
report examines the diverse experiences of seven countries, with 
a specific focus on the enabling environment for food security 
and nutrition that reflects commitment and capacities across four 
dimensions: policies, programmes and legal frameworks; mobilization 
of human and financial resources; coordination mechanisms 
and partnerships; and evidence-based decision-making.
